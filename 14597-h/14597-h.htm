<h2>THE AUTHOR TO THE READER</h2>
<p><i>How much of the story of Mary O'Neill is a work of my own
imagination, and how much comes from an authentic source I do not
consider it necessary to say. But as I have in this instance drawn
more largely and directly from fact than is usually the practice of
the novelist, I have thought it my duty to defeat all possible
attempts at personal identification by altering and disguising the
more important scenes and characters. Therefore this novel is not
to be understood as referring to any living person or persons, and
the convent school described in it is not to be identified with any
similar educational institution in Rome</i>.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>MARTIN CONRAD TO THE AUTHOR</h2>
<p><i>Here are the Memoranda we have talked about. Do as you like
with them. Alter, amend, add to or take away from them, exactly as
you think best. They were written in the first instance for my own
eye alone, and hence they take much for granted which may need
explanation before they can be put to the more general uses you
have designed for them. Make such explanation in any way you
consider suitable. It is my wish that in this matter your judgment
should be accepted as mine. The deep feeling you could not conceal
when I told you the story of my dear one's life gives me confidence
in your discretion.</i></p>
<p><i>Whatever the immediate effect may be, I feel that in the end
I shall be justified&mdash;fully justified&mdash;in allowing the
public to look for a little while into the sacred confessional of
my darling's stainless heart.</i></p>
<p><i>I heard her voice again to-day. She was right&mdash;love is
immortal. God bless her! My ever lovely and beloved one!</i></p>

CHAPTER</h2>
<p>"Out of the depths, O Lord, out of the depths," begins the most
beautiful of the services of our church, and it is out of the
depths of my life that I must bring the incidents of this
story.</p>
<p>I was an unwanted child&mdash;unwanted as a girl at all events.
Father Dan Donovan, our parish priest, told me all about it. I was
born in October. It had been raining heavily all day long. The rain
was beating hard against the front of our house and running in
rivers down the window-panes. Towards four in the afternoon the
wind rose and then the yellow leaves of the chestnuts in the long
drive rustled noisily, and the sea, which is a mile away, moaned
like a dog in pain.</p>
<p>In my father's room, on the ground floor, Father Dan sat by the
fire, fingering his beads and listening to every sound that came
from my mother's room, which was immediately overhead. My father
himself, with his heavy step that made the house tremble, was
tramping to and fro, from the window to the ingle, from the ingle
to the opposite wall. Sometimes Aunt Bridget came down to say that
everything was going on well, and at intervals of half an hour
Doctor Conrad entered in his noiseless way and sat in silence by
the fire, took a few puffs from a long clay pipe and then returned
to his charge upstairs.</p>
<p>My father's impatience was consuming him.</p>
<p>"It's long," he said, searching the doctor's face.</p>
<p>"Don't worry&mdash;above all don't worry," said Father Dan.</p>
<p>"There's no need," said Doctor Conrad.</p>
<p>"Then hustle back and get it over," said my father. "It will be
five hundred dollars to you if this comes off all right."</p>
<p>I think my father was a great man at that time. I think he is
still a great man. Hard and cruel as he may have been to me, I feel
bound to say that for him. If he had been born a king, he would
have made his nation feared and perhaps respected throughout the
world. He was born a peasant, the poorest of peasants, a crofter.
The little homestead of his family, with its whitewashed walls and
straw-thatched roof, still stands on the bleak ayre-lands of Ellan,
like a herd of mottled cattle crouching together in a storm.</p>
<p>His own father had been a wild creature, full of daring dreams,
and the chief of them had centred in himself. Although brought up
in a mud cabin, and known as Daniel Neale, he believed that he
belonged by lineal descent to the highest aristocracy of his
island, the O'Neills of the Mansion House (commonly called the Big
House) and the Barons of Castle Raa. To prove his claim he spent
his days in searching the registers of the parish churches, and his
nights in talking loudly in the village inn. Half in jest and half
in earnest, people called him "Neale the Lord." One day he was
brought home dead, killed in a drunken quarrel with Captain
O'Neill, a dissolute braggart, who had struck him over the temple
with a stick. His wife, my grandmother, hung a herring net across
the only room of her house to hide his body from the children who
slept in the other bed.</p>
<p>There were six of them, and after the death of her husband she
had to fend for all. The little croft was hungry land, and to make
a sufficient living she used to weed for her more prosperous
neighbours. It was ill-paid labour&mdash;ninepence a day fine days
and sixpence all weathers, with a can of milk twice a week and a
lump of butter thrown in now and then. The ways were hard and the
children were the first to feel them. Five of them died. "They
weren't willing to stay with me," she used to say. My father alone
was left to her, and he was another Daniel. As he grew up he was a
great help to his mother. I feel sure he loved her. Difficult as it
may be to believe it now, I really and truly think that his natural
disposition was lovable and generous to begin with.</p>
<p>There is a story of his boyhood which it would be wrong of me
not to tell. His mother and he had been up in the mountains cutting
gorse and ling, which with turf from the Curragh used to be the
crofter's only fuel. They were dragging down a prickly pile of it
by a straw rope when, dipping into the high road by a bridge, they
crossed the path of a splendid carriage which swirled suddenly out
of the drive of the Big House behind two high-spirited bays driven
by an English coachman in gorgeous livery. The horses reared and
shied at the bundle of kindling, whereupon a gentleman inside the
carriage leaned out and swore, and then the brutal coachman,
lashing out at the bare-headed woman with his whip, struck the boy
on his naked legs.</p>
<p>At the next moment the carriage had gone. It had belonged to the
head of the O'Neills, Lord Raa of Castle Raa, whose nearest
kinsman, Captain O'Neill, had killed my grandfather, so my poor
grandmother said nothing. But her little son, as soon as his
smarting legs would allow, wiped his eyes with his ragged sleeve
and said:</p>
<p>"Never mind, mammy. You shall have a carriage of your own when I
am a man, and then nobody shall never lash you."</p>
<p>His mother died. He was twenty years of age at that time, a
large-limbed, lusty-lunged fellow, almost destitute of education
but with a big brain and an unconquerable will; so he strapped his
chest and emigrated to America. What work he found at first I never
rightly knew. I can only remember to have heard that it was
something dangerous to human life and that the hands above him
dropped off rapidly. Within two years he was a foreman. Within five
years he was a partner. In ten years he was a rich man. At the end
of five-and-twenty years he was a millionaire, controlling trusts
and corporations and carrying out great combines.</p>
<p>I once heard him say that the money tumbled into his chest like
crushed oats out of a crown shaft, but what happened at last was
never fully explained to me. Something I heard of a collision with
the law and of a forced assignment of his interests. All that is
material to my story is that at forty-five years of age he returned
to Ellan. He was then a changed man, with a hard tongue, a stern
mouth, and a masterful lift of the eyebrows. His passion for wealth
had left its mark upon him, but the whole island went down before
his face like a flood, and the people who had made game of his
father came crawling to his feet like cockroaches.</p>
<p>The first thing he did on coming home was to buy up his mother's
croft, re-thatch the old house, and put in a poor person to take
care of it.</p>
<p>"Guess it may come handy some day," he said.</p>
<p>His next act was worthy of the son of "Neale the Lord." Finding
that Captain O'Neill had fallen deeply into debt, he bought up the
braggart's mortgages, turned him out of the Big House, and took up
his own abode in it.</p>
<p>Twelve months later he made amends, after his own manner, by
marrying one of the Captain's daughters. There were two of them.
Isabel, the elder, was a gentle and beautiful girl, very delicate,
very timid, and most sweet when most submissive, like the woodland
herbs which give out their sweetest fragrance when they are trodden
on and crushed. Bridget, the younger, was rather homely, rather
common, proud of her strength of mind and will.</p>
<p>To the deep chagrin of the younger sister, my father selected
the elder one. I have never heard that my mother's wishes were
consulted. Her father and my father dealt with the marriage as a
question of business, and that was an end of the matter. On the
wedding day my father did two things that were highly significant.
He signed the parish register in the name of Daniel O'Neill by
right of Letters Patent; and on taking his bride back to her early
home, he hoisted over the tower of his chill grey house the stars
and stripes of his once adopted country stitched to the flag of his
native island. He had talked less than "Neale the Lord," but he had
thought and acted more.</p>
<p>Two years passed without offspring, and my father made no
disguise of his disappointment, which almost amounted to disgust.
Hitherto he had occupied himself with improvements in his house and
estate, but now his restless energies required a wider field, and
he began to look about him. Ellan was then a primitive place, and
its inhabitants, half landsmen, half seamen, were a simple pious
race living in a sweet poverty which rarely descended into want.
But my father had magnificent schemes for it. By push, energy and
enterprise he would galvanise the island into new life, build
hotels, theatres, casinos, drinking halls and dancing palaces, lay
out race-courses, construct electric railways to the tops of the
mountains, and otherwise transform the place into a holiday resort
for the people of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>"We'll just sail in and make this old island hum," he said, and
a number of his neighbours, nothing loth to be made rich by
magic&mdash;advocates, bankers and insular councillors&mdash;joined
hands with him in his adventurous schemes.</p>
<p>But hardly had he begun when a startling incident happened. The
old Lord Raa of Castle Raa, head of the O'Neills, the same that had
sworn at my grandmother, after many years in which he had lived a
bad life abroad where he had contracted fatal maladies, returned to
Ellan to die. Being a bachelor, his heir would have been Captain
O'Neill, but my mother's father had died during the previous
winter, and in the absence of direct male issue it seemed likely
that both title and inheritance (which, by the conditions of an old
Patent, might have descended to the nearest living male through the
female line) would go to a distant relative, a boy, fourteen years
of age, a Protestant, who was then at school at Eton.</p>
<p>More than ever now my father chewed the cud of his great
disappointment. But it is the unexpected that oftenest happens, and
one day in the spring, Doctor Conrad, being called to see my
mother, who was indisposed, announced that she was about to bear a
child.</p>
<p>My father's delight was almost delirious, though at first his
happiness was tempered by the fear that the child that was to be
born to him might not prove a boy. Even this danger disappeared
from his mind after a time, and before long his vanity and his
unconquerable will had so triumphed over his common sense that he
began to speak of his unborn child as a son, just as if the birth
of a male child had been prearranged. With my mother, with Doctor
Conrad, and above all with Father Dan, he sometimes went the length
of discussing his son's name. It was to be Hugh, because that had
been the name of the heads of the O'Neills through all the ages, as
far back as the legendary days in which, as it was believed, they
had been the Kings of Ellan.</p>
<p>My mother was no less overjoyed. She had justified herself at
last, and if she was happy enough at the beginning in the tingling
delight of the woman who is about to know the sweetest of human
joys, the joy of bearing a child, she acquiesced at length in the
accepted idea that her child would be a boy. Perhaps she was moved
to this merely by a desire to submit to her husband's will, and to
realise his hopes and expectations. Or perhaps she had another
reason, a secret reason, a reason that came of her own weakness and
timidity as a woman, namely, that the man child to be born of her
would be strong and brave and free.</p>
<p>All went well down to the end of autumn, and then alarming news
came from Castle Raa. The old lord had developed some further
malady and was believed to be sinking rapidly. Doctor Conrad was
consulted and he gave it as his opinion that the patient could not
live beyond the year. This threw my father into a fever of anxiety.
Sending for his advocate, he took counsel both with him and with
Father Dan.</p>
<p>"Come now, let us get the hang of this business," he said; and
when he realised that (according to the terms of the ancient
Patent) if the old lord died before his child was born, his
high-built hopes would be in the dust, his eagerness became a
consuming fire.</p>
<p>For the first time in his life his excitement took forms of
religion and benevolence. He promised that if everything went well
he would give a new altar to Our Lady's Chapel in the parish church
of St. Mary, a ton of coals to every poor person within a radius of
five miles, and a supper to every inhabitant of the neighbouring
village who was more than sixty years of age. It was even rumoured
that he went so far in secret as to provide funds for the fireworks
with which some of his flatterers were to celebrate the forthcoming
event, and that one form of illumination was a gigantic frame
which, set upon the Sky Hill, immediately in front of our house,
was intended to display in brilliant lights the glowing words "God
Bless the Happy Heir." Certainly the birth was to be announced by
the ringing of the big bell of the tower as signal to the country
round about that the appointed festivities might begin.</p>
<p>Day by day through September into October, news came from Castle
Raa by secret channels. Morning by morning, Doctor Conrad was sent
for to see my mother. Never had the sun looked down on a more
gruesome spectacle. It was a race between the angel of death and
the angel of life, with my father's masterful soul between,
struggling to keep back the one and to hasten on the other.</p>
<p>My father's impatience affected everybody about him. Especially
it communicated itself to the person chiefly concerned. The result
was just what might have been expected. My mother was brought to
bed prematurely, a full month before her time.</p>

<h2><a name="SECOND_CHAPTER" id="SECOND_CHAPTER"></a>SECOND
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>By six o'clock the wind had risen to the force of a hurricane.
The last of the withered leaves of the trees in the drive had
fallen and the bare branches were beating together like bundles of
rods. The sea was louder than ever, and the bell on St. Mary's
Rock, a mile away from the shore, was tolling like a knell under
the surging of the waves. Sometimes the clashing of the rain
against the window-panes was like the wash of billows over the
port-holes of a ship at sea.</p>
<p>"Pity for the poor folk with their fireworks," said Father
Dan.</p>
<p>"They'll eat their suppers for all that," said my father.</p>
<p>It was now dark, but my father would not allow the lamps to be
lighted. There was therefore no light in his gaunt room except a
sullen glow from the fire of peat and logs. Sometimes, in a
momentary lull of the storm, an intermittent moan would come from
the room above, followed by a dull hum of voices.</p>
<p>"Guess it can't be long now," my father would say.</p>
<p>"Praise the Lord," Father Dan would answer.</p>
<p>By seven the storm was at its height. The roaring of the wind in
the wide chimney was as loud as thunder. Save for this the
thunderous noise of the sea served to drown all sounds on the land.
Nevertheless, in the midst of the clamour a loud rapping was heard
at the front door. One of the maid-servants would have answered it,
but my father called her back and, taking up a lantern, went to the
door himself. As quietly as he could for the rush of wind without,
he opened it, and pulling it after him, he stepped into the
porch.</p>
<p>A man in livery was there on horseback, with another saddled
horse beside him. He was drenched through, but steaming with sweat
as if he had ridden long and hard. Shouting above the roar of the
storm, he said:</p>
<p>"Doctor Conrad is here, is he?"</p>
<p>"He is&mdash;what of it?" said my father.</p>
<p>"Tell him he's wanted and must come away with me at once."</p>
<p>"Who says he must?"</p>
<p>"Lord Raa. His lordship is dangerously ill. He wishes to see the
doctor immediately."</p>
<p>I think my father must then have gone through a moment of fierce
conflict between his desire to keep the old lord alive and his hope
of the immediate birth of his offspring. But his choice was quickly
made.</p>
<p>"Tell the lord," he cried, "that a woman is here in child-birth,
and until she's delivered the doctor cannot come to him."</p>
<p>"But I've brought a horse, and the doctor is to go back with
me."</p>
<p>"Give the lord my message and say it is Daniel O'Neill who sends
it."</p>
<p>"But his lordship is dying and unless the doctor is there to tap
him, he may not live till morning."</p>
<p>"Unless the doctor is here to deliver my wife, my child may be
dead before midnight."</p>
<p>"What is the birth of your child to the death of his lordship?"
cried the man; but, before the words were well out of his mouth, my
father, in his great strength, had laid hold of the reins and swung
both horse and rider round about.</p>
<p>"Get yourself to the other side of my gate, or I'll fling you
into the road," he cried; and then, returning to the porch, he
re-entered the house and clashed the door behind him.</p>
<p>Father Dan used to say that for some moments more the groom from
Castle Raa could be heard shouting the name of the doctor to the
lighted windows of my mother's room. But his voice was swirled away
in the whistling of the wind, and after a while the hoofs of his
horses went champing over the gravel in the direction of the
gate.</p>
<p>When my father returned to his room, shaking the rain from his
hair and beard, he was fuming with indignation. Perhaps a memory of
forty years ago was seething in his excited brain.</p>
<p>"The old scoundrel," he said. "He'd like it, wouldn't he? They'd
all like it! Which of them wants a son of mine amongst them?"</p>
<p>The roaring night outside became yet more terrible. So loud was
the noise from the shore that it was almost as if a wild beast were
trying to liberate itself from the womb of the sea. At one moment
Aunt Bridget came downstairs to say that the storm was frightening
my mother. All the servants of the house were gathered in the hall,
full of fear, and telling each other superstitious stories.</p>
<p>Suddenly there came a lull. Rain and wind seemed to cease in an
instant. The clamour of the sea became less and the tolling of the
bell on St. Mary's Rock died away in the distance. It was almost as
if the world, which had been whirling through space, suddenly stood
still.</p>
<p>In that moment of silence a deeper moan than usual came from the
room overhead. My father dropped into a chair, clasped his hands
and closed his eyes. Father Dan rattled his pearl beads and moved
his lips, but uttered no sound.</p>
<p>Then a faint sound came from the room overhead. My father opened
his eyes and listened. Father Dan held his breath. The sound was
repeated, but louder, clearer, shriller than before. There could be
no mistaking it now. It was Nature's eternal signal that out of the
womb of silence a living soul had been born into the world.</p>
<p>"It's over," said my father.</p>
<p>"Glory be to God and all the Saints!" said Father Dan.</p>
<p>"That'll beat 'em," cried my father, and he leapt to his feet
and laughed.</p>
<p>Going to the door of the room, he flung it open. The servants in
the hall were now whispering eagerly, and one of them, the
gardener, Tom Dug, commonly called Tommy the Mate, stepped out and
asked if he ought to ring the big bell.</p>
<p>"Certainly," said my father. "Isn't that what you've been
standing by for?"</p>
<p>A few minutes later the bell of the tower began to ring, and it
was followed almost immediately by the bell of our parish church,
which rang out a merry peal.</p>
<p>"That'll beat 'em, I say," cried my father, and laughing in his
triumph he tramped the flagged floor with a firmer step than
ever.</p>
<p>All at once the crying of the child ceased and there was a
confused rumble of voices overhead. My father stopped, his face
straightened, and his voice, which had rung out like a horn,
wheezed back like a whistle.</p>
<p>"What's going doing? Where's Conrad? Why doesn't Conrad come to
me?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry. He'll be down presently," said Father Dan.</p>
<p>A few minutes passed, in which nothing was said and nothing
heard, and then, unable to bear the suspense any longer, my father
went to the foot of the staircase and shouted the doctor's
name.</p>
<p>A moment later the doctor's footsteps were heard on the stone
stairs. They were hesitating, halting, dragging footsteps. Then the
doctor entered my father's room. Even in the sullen light of the
peat fire his face was white, ashen white. He did not speak at
first, and there was an instant of silence, dead silence. Then my
father said:</p>
<p>"Well, what is it?"</p>
<p>"It is . . ."</p>
<p>"Speak man! . . . Do you mean it is . . . <i>dead?</i>"</p>
<p>"No! Oh no! Not that."</p>
<p>"What then?"</p>
<p>"It is a girl."</p>
<p>"A gir . . . Did you say a girl?"</p>
<p>"Yes.</p>
<p>"My God!" said my father, and he dropped back into the chair.
His lips were parted and his eyes which had been blazing with joy,
became fixed on the dying fire in a stupid stare.</p>
<p>Father Dan tried to console him. There were thistles in
everybody's crop, and after all it was a good thing to have
begotten a girl. Girls were the flowers of life, the joy and
comfort of man in his earthly pilgrimage, and many a father who
bemoaned his fate when a daughter had been born to him, had lived
to thank the Lord for her.</p>
<p>All this time the joy bells had been ringing, and now the room
began to be illuminated by fitful flashes of variegated light from
the firework-frame on the top of Sky Hill, which (as well as it
could for the rain that had soaked it) was sputtering out its
mocking legend, "God Bless the Happy Heir."</p>
<p>In his soft Irish voice, which was like a river running over
smooth stones, Father Dan went on with his comforting.</p>
<p>"Yes, women are the salt of the earth, God bless them, and when
I think of what they suffer that the world may go on, that the
generations may not fail, I feel as if I want to go down on my
knees and kiss the feet of the first woman I meet in the street.
What would the world be without women? Think of St. Theresa! Think
of the Blessed Margaret Mary! Think of the Holy Virgin herself. . .
."</p>
<p>"Oh, stow this stuff," cried my father, and leaping to his feet,
he began to curse and swear.</p>
<p>"Stop that accursed bell! Is the fool going to ring for ever?
Put out those damnable lights, too. Put them out. Are the devils of
hell trying to laugh at me?"</p>
<p>With that, and an oath at himself for his folly, my father
strode out of the room.</p>
<p>My mother had heard him. Through the unceiled timbers of the
floor between them the words of his rage had reached her. She was
ashamed. She felt as if she were a guilty thing, and with a low cry
of pain she turned to the wall and fainted.</p>
<p>The old lord died the same night. Somewhere towards the dead
reaches of the dawn his wicked spirit went to its reckoning, and a
month afterwards the new Lord Raa, a boy in an Eton jacket, came
over to take possession of his inheritance.</p>
<p>But long before that my father, scoring out his disappointment
like an account that was closed, had got to work with his
advocates, bankers and insular councillors on his great schemes for
galvanising the old island into new life.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THIRD_CHAPTER" id="THIRD_CHAPTER"></a>THIRD
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Out of the mist and veil of my own memory, as distinguished from
Father Dan's, there comes first the recollection of a big room
containing a big bed, a big wardrobe, a big dressing table, a big
praying-stool with an image of Our Lady on the wall above it, and
an open window to which a sparrow used to come in the mornings and
chirp.</p>
<p>When I came to recognise and to classify I realised that this
was my mother's room, and that the sweet somebody who used to catch
me up in her arms when I went tottering on voyages of discovery
round the vast place was my mother herself, and that she would
comfort me when I fell, and stroke my head with her thin white
hand, while she sang softly and rocked me to and fro.</p>
<p>As I have no recollection of ever having seen my mother in any
other part of our house, or indeed in any other place except our
carriage when we drove out in the sunshine, I conclude that from
the time of my birth she had been an invalid.</p>
<p>Certainly the faces which first emerge from the islands of my
memory are the cheerful and sunny ones of Doctor Conrad and Father
Dan. I recall the soft voice of the one as he used to enter our
room after breakfast saying, "How are we this morning ma'am?" And I
remember the still softer voice of the other as he said "And how is
my daughter to-day?"</p>
<p>I loved both of them, but especially Father Dan, who used to
call me his Nanny and say I was the plague and pet of his life,
being as full of mischief as a goat. He must have been an old child
himself, for I have clear recollection of how, immediately after
confessing my mother, he would go down on all fours with me on the
floor and play at hide-and-seek around the legs of the big bed,
amid squeals and squeaks of laughter. I remember, too, that he wore
a long sack coat which buttoned close at the neck and hung loose at
the skirts, where there were two large vertical pockets, and that
these pockets were my cupboards and drawers, for I put my toys and
my doll and even the remnants of my cakes into them to be kept in
safe custody until wanted again.</p>
<p>My mother called me Mally veen (Mary dear) and out of love of
her only child she must have weaned me late, for I have vague
memories of her soft white breasts filled with milk. I slept in a
little wickerwork cot placed near her bed, so that she could reach
me if I uncovered myself in the night. She used to say I was like a
bird, having something birdlike in my small dark head and the way I
held it up. Certainly I remember myself as a swift little thing,
always darting to and fro on tiptoe, and chirping about our chill
and rather cheerless house.</p>
<p>If I was like a bird my mother was like a flower. Her head,
which was small and fair, and her face, which was nearly always
tinged with colour, drooped forward from her delicate body like a
rose from its stalk. She was generally dressed in black, I
remember, but she wore a white lace collar as well as a coif such
as we see in old pictures, and when I call her back to my mind,
with her large liquid eyes and her sweet soft mouth, I think it
cannot be my affection alone, or the magic of my childish memory,
which makes me think, after all these years and all the countries I
have travelled in, and all the women I have seen, that my darling
mother, though so little known and so little loved, was the most
beautiful woman in the world.</p>
<p>Even yet I cannot but wonder that other people, my father
especially, did not see her with my eyes. I think he was fond of
her after his own fashion, but there was a kind of involuntary
contempt in his affection, which could not conceal itself from my
quick little eyes. She was visibly afraid of him, and was always
nervous and timid when he came into our room with his customary
salutation,</p>
<p>"How now, Isabel? And how's this child of yours?"</p>
<p>From my earliest childhood I noticed that he always spoke of me
as if I had been my mother's child, not his, and perhaps this
affected my feeling for him from the first.</p>
<p>I was in terror of his loud voice and rough manner, the big
bearded man with the iron grey head and the smell of the fresh air
about his thick serge clothes. It was almost as if I had conceived
this fear before my birth, and had brought it out of the tremulous
silence of my mother's womb.</p>
<p>My earliest recollections are of his muffled shout from the room
below, "Keep your child quiet, will you?" when I was disturbing him
over his papers by leaping and skipping about the floor. If he came
upstairs when I was in bed I would dive under the bedclothes, as a
duck dives under water, and only come to the surface when he was
gone. I am sure I never kissed my father or climbed on to his knee,
and that during his short visits to our room I used to hold my
breath and hide my head behind my mother's gown.</p>
<p>I think my mother must have suffered both from my fear of my
father and from my father's indifference to me, for she made many
efforts to reconcile him to my existence. Some of her innocent
schemes, as I recall them now, seem very sweet but very pitiful.
She took pride, for instance, in my hair, which was jet black even
when I was a child, and she used to part it in the middle and brush
it smooth over my forehead in the manner of the Madonna, and one
day, when my father was with us, she drew me forward and said:</p>
<p>"Don't you think our Mary is going to be very pretty? A little
like the pictures of Our Lady, perhaps&mdash;don't you think so,
Daniel?"</p>
<p>Whereupon my father laughed rather derisively and answered:</p>
<p>"Pretty, is she? Like the Virgin, eh? Well, well!"</p>
<p>I was always fond of music, and my mother used to teach me to
sing to a little upright piano which she was allowed to keep in her
room, and on another day she said:</p>
<p>"Do you know our Mary has such a beautiful voice, dear? So sweet
and pure that when I close my eyes I could almost think it is an
angel singing."</p>
<p>Whereupon my father laughed as before, and answered:</p>
<p>"A voice, has she? Like an angel's, is it? What next, I
wonder?"</p>
<p>My mother made most of my clothes. There was no need for her to
do so, but in the absence of household duties I suppose it
stimulated the tenderness which all mothers feel in covering the
little limbs they love; and one day, having made a velvet frock for
me, from a design in an old pattern book of coloured prints, which
left the legs and neck and arms very bare, she said:</p>
<p>"Isn't our Mary a little lady? But she will always look like a
lady, whatever she is dressed in."</p>
<p>And then my father laughed still more contemptuously and
replied,</p>
<p>"Her grandmother weeded turnips in the fields
though&mdash;ninepence a day dry days, and sixpence all
weathers."</p>
<p>My mother was deeply religious, never allowing a day to pass
without kneeling on her prayer-stool before the image of the
Virgin, and one day I heard her tell my father that when I was a
little mite, scarcely able to speak, she found me kneeling in my
cot with my doll perched up before me, moving my lips as if saying
my prayers and looking up at the ceiling with a rapt
expression.</p>
<p>"But she has always had such big, beautiful, religious eyes, and
I shouldn't wonder if she becomes a Nun some day!"</p>
<p>"A nun, eh? Maybe so. But I take no stock in the nun business
anyway," said my father.</p>
<p>Whereupon my mother's lips moved as if she were saying "No,
dearest," but her dear, sweet pride was crushed and she could go no
farther.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FOURTH_CHAPTER" id="FOURTH_CHAPTER"></a>FOURTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>There was a whole colony on the ground floor of our house who,
like my father, could not reconcile themselves to my existence, and
the head of them was Aunt Bridget.</p>
<p>She had been married, soon after the marriage of my mother, to
one Colonel MacLeod, a middle-aged officer on half-pay, a widower,
a Belfast Irishman, and a tavern companion of my maternal
grandfather. But the Colonel had died within a year, leaving Aunt
Bridget with one child of her own, a girl, as well as a daughter of
his wife by the former marriage. As this happened about the time of
my birth, when it became obvious that my mother was to be an
invalid, my father invited Aunt Bridget to come to his house as
housekeeper, and she came, and brought her children with her.</p>
<p>Her rule from the outset had been as hard as might have been
expected from one who prided herself on her self-command&mdash;a
quality that covered everybody, including my mother and me, and was
only subject to softening in favour of her own offspring.</p>
<p>Aunt Bridget's own daughter, a year older than myself, was a
fair child with light grey eyes, round cheeks of the colour of ripe
apples, and long yellow hair that was carefully combed and curled.
Her name was Betsy, which was extended by her mother to Betsy
Beauty. She was usually dressed in a muslin frock with a sash of
light blue ribbon, and being understood to be delicate was
constantly indulged and nearly always eating, and giving herself
generally the airs of the daughter of the house.</p>
<p>Aunt Bridget's step-daughter, ten years older, was a gaunt,
ungainly girl with red hair and irregular features. Her name was
Nessy, and, having an instinctive sense of her dependent position,
she was very humble and subservient and, as Tommy the Mate used to
say, "as smooth as an old threepenny bit" to the ruling powers,
which always meant my Aunt, but spiteful, insolent, and acrid to
anybody who was outside my Aunt's favour, which usually meant
me.</p>
<p>Between my cousin and myself there were constant feuds, in which
Nessy MacLeod never failed to take the side of Betsy Beauty, while
my poor mother became a target for the shafts of Aunt Bridget, who
said I was a wilful, wicked, underhand little vixen, and no wonder,
seeing how disgracefully I was indulged, and how shockingly I was
being brought up.</p>
<p>These skirmishes went on for a considerable time without
consequences, but they came at last to a foolish climax which led
to serious results.</p>
<p>Even my mother's life had its gleams of sunshine, and flowers
were a constant joy to her. Old Tommy, the gardener, was aware of
this, and every morning sent up a bunch of them, freshly cut and
wet with the dew. But one day in the spring he could not do so,
being out in the dubs of the Curragh, cutting peat for the fires.
Therefore I undertook to supply the deficiency, having already,
with the large solemnity of six, begun to consider it my duty to
take charge of my mother.</p>
<p>"Never mind, mammy, I'll setch some slowers sor you," I said
(every <i>f</i> being an <i>s</i> in those days), and armed with a
pair of scissors I skipped down to the garden.</p>
<p>I had chosen a bed of annuals because they were bright and
fragrant, and was beginning to cut some "gilvers" when Nessy
MacLeod, who had been watching from a window, came bouncing down
me.</p>
<p>"Mary O'Neill, how dare you?" cried Nessy. "You wilful, wicked,
underhand little vixen, what will your Aunt Bridget say? Don't you
know this is Betsy Beauty's bed, and nobody else is to touch
it?"</p>
<p>I began to excuse myself on the ground of my mother and Tommy
the Mate, but Nessy would hear no such explanation.</p>
<p>"Your mamma has nothing to do with it. You know quite well that
your Aunt Bridget manages everything in this house, and nothing can
be done without her."</p>
<p>Small as I was that was too much for me. Somewhere in my little
heart there had long been a secret pang of mortified
pride&mdash;how born I do not know&mdash;at seeing Aunt Bridget
take the place of my mother, and now, choking with vexation but
without saying a word, I swept off the heads of all the flowers in
the bed, and with my arms full of them&mdash;ten times more than I
wanted&mdash;I sailed back to my mother's room.</p>
<p>Inside two minutes there was a fearful tumult. I thought I was
doomed to punishment when I heard the big bunch of keys, which Aunt
Bridget kept suspended from her waist, come jingling up the stairs,
but it was my poor mother who paid the penalty.</p>
<p>"Isabel," cried Aunt Bridget, "I hope you are satisfied with
your child at last."</p>
<p>"What has Mary been doing now, dear?" said my mother.</p>
<p>"Don't ask me what she has been doing. You know quite well, or
if you don't you ought to."</p>
<p>My mother glanced at the flowers and she seemed to understand
what had happened, for her face fell and she said submissively,</p>
<p>"Mary has done wrong, but I am sure she is sorry and will never
do it again."</p>
<p>"Sorry, indeed!" cried my Aunt. "Not she sorry. And she'll do it
again at the very next opportunity. The vixen! The little wilful,
underhand vixen! But what wonder if children go wrong when their
own mothers neglect to correct them."</p>
<p>"I daresay you are quite right, dear Bridget&mdash;you are
always right," said my mother in a low, grave voice. "But then I'm
not very well, and Mary is all I have, you know."</p>
<p>My mother was in tears by this time, but Aunt Bridget was not
content with her triumph. Sweeping downstairs she carried her
complaint to my father, who ordered that I was to be taken out of
my mother's charge on the ground that she was incapable of
attending to my upbringing&mdash;a task which, being assigned to my
Aunt Bridget, provided that I should henceforward live on the
ground floor and eat oaten cake and barley bonnag and sleep alone
in the cold room over the hall while Betsy Beauty ate wheaten bread
and apple tart and slept with her mother in the room over the
kitchen in which they always kept a fire.</p>

<h2><a name="FIFTH_CHAPTER" id="FIFTH_CHAPTER"></a>FIFTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>The altered arrangements were a cause of grief to my mother, but
I am bound to confess that for me they had certain compensations.
One of them was the greater ease with which I could slip out to
Tommy the Mate, who had been a sailor before he was a gardener, and
was still a fine old salt, with grizzled beard and shaggy eyebrows,
and a merry twinkle in what he called his "starboard" eye.</p>
<p>I think Tommy was one of the few about my father's house who
were really fond of me, but perhaps that was mainly because he
loathed aunt Bridget. He used to call her the Big Woman, meaning
that she was the master and mistress of everything and everybody
about the place. When he was told of any special piece of her
tyranny to servant or farmhand he used to say: "Aw, well, she'll
die for all"; and when he heard how she had separated me from my
mother, who had nothing else to love or live for, he spat sideways
out of his mouth and said:</p>
<p>"Our Big Woman is a wicked devil, I'm thinking, and I wouldn't
trust [shouldn't wonder] but she'll burn in hell."</p>
<p>What definite idea I attached to this denunciation I do not now
recall, but I remember that it impressed me deeply, and that many a
night afterwards, during the miserable half-hours before I fell
asleep with my head under the clothes in the cold bedroom over the
hall to which (as Nessy MacLeod had told me) the bad fairies came
for bad children, I repeated the strange words again and again.</p>
<p>Another compensation was the greater opportunity I had for
cultivating an acquaintance which I had recently made with the
doctor's son, when he came with his father on visits to my mother.
As soon as the hoofs of the horse were heard on the gravel, and
before the bell could be rung, I used to dart away on tiptoe, fly
through the porch, climb into the gig and help the boy to hold the
reins while his father was upstairs.</p>
<p>This led to what I thought a great discovery. It was about my
mother. I had always known my mother was sick, but now I got a
"skute" (as old Tommy used to say) into the cause of her illness.
It was a matter of milk. The doctor's boy had heard his father
saying so. If my mother could only have milk morning, noon and
night, every day and all day, "there wouldn't be nothing the matter
with her."</p>
<p>This, too, impressed me deeply, and the form it took in my mind
was that "mammy wasn't sed enough," a conclusion that gained colour
from the fact that I saw Betsy Beauty perched up in a high chair in
the dining-room twice or thrice a day, drinking nice warm milk
fresh from the cow. We had three cows, I remember, and to correct
the mischief of my mother's illness, I determined that henceforth
she should not have merely more of our milk&mdash;she should have
all of it.</p>
<p>Losing no time in carrying my intentions into effect, I crept
into the dairy as soon as the dairymaid had brought in the
afternoon's milking. There it was, still frothing and bubbling in
three great bowls, and taking up the first of them in my little
thin arms&mdash;goodness knows how&mdash;I made straight for my
mother's room.</p>
<p>But hardly had I climbed half-way up the stairs, puffing and
panting under my burden, when I met Nessy MacLeod coming down, and
she fell on me with her usual reproaches.</p>
<p>"Mary O'Neill, you wilful, underhand little vixen, whatever are
you doing with the milk?"</p>
<p>Being in no mood for explanations I tried to push past, but
Nessy prevented me.</p>
<p>"No, indeed, you shan't go a step further. What will your Aunt
Bridget say? Take the milk back, miss, this very minute."</p>
<p>Nessy's loud protest brought Betsy Beauty out of the
dining-room, and in a moment my cousin, looking more than ever like
a painted doll in her white muslin dress with a large blue bow in
her yellow hair, had run upstairs to assist her step-sister.</p>
<p>I was now between the two, the one above and the other below,
and they laid hold of my bowl to take it from me. They tugged and I
resisted and there was a struggle in which the milk was in danger
of being spilled.</p>
<p>"She's a stubborn little thing and she ought to be whipped,"
cried Nessy.</p>
<p>"She's stealing my milk, and I'll tell mamma," said Betsy.</p>
<p>"Tell her then," I cried, and in a burst of anger at finding
myself unable to recover control of my bowl I swept it round and
flung its contents over my cousin's head, thereby drenching her
with the frothing milk and making the staircase to run like a river
of whitewash.</p>
<p>Of course there was a fearful clamour. Betsy Beauty shrieked and
Nessy bellowed, whereupon Aunt Bridget came racing from her
parlour, while my mother, white and trembling, halted to the door
of her room.</p>
<p>"Mally, Mally, what have you done?" cried my mother, but Aunt
Bridget found no need of questions. After running upstairs to her
dripping daughter, wiping her down with a handkerchief, calling her
"my poor darling," and saying, "Didn't I tell you to have nothing
more to do with that little vixen?" she fell on my mother with
bitter upbraidings.</p>
<p>"Isabel, I hope you see now what your minx of a child
is&mdash;the little spiteful fury!"</p>
<p>By this time I had dropped my empty bowl on the stairs and taken
refuge behind my mother's gown, but I heard her timid voice trying
to excuse me, and saying something about my cousin and a childish
quarrel.</p>
<p>"Childish quarrel, indeed!" cried my Aunt; "there's nothing
childish about that little imp, nothing. And what's more, I shall
be obliged to you, Isabel, if you will never again have the
assurance to speak of my Betsy Beauty in the same breath with a
child of yours."</p>
<p>That was more than I could hear. My little heart was afire at
the humiliation put upon my mother. So stepping out to the head of
the stairs, I shouted down in my shrillest treble:</p>
<p>"Your Betsy Beauty is a wicked devil, and I wouldn't trust but
she'll burn in hell!"</p>
<p>Never, to the last hour of my life, shall I forget the effect of
that pronouncement. One moment Aunt Bridget stood speechless in the
middle of the stairs, as if all breath had been broken out of her.
Then, ghastly white and without a word, she came flying up at me,
and, before I could recover my usual refuge, she caught me, slapped
me on the cheek and boxed both my ears.</p>
<p>I do not remember if I cried, but I know my mother did, and that
in the midst of the general tumult my father came out of his room
and demanded in a loud voice, which seemed to shake the whole
house, to be told what was going on.</p>
<p>Aunt Bridget told him, with various embellishments, which my
mother did not attempt to correct, and then, knowing she was in the
wrong, she began to wipe her eyes with her wet handkerchief, and to
say she could not live any longer where a child was encouraged to
insult her.</p>
<p>"I have to leave this house&mdash;I have to leave it to-morrow,"
she said.</p>
<p>"You don't have to do no such thing," cried my father. "But I'm
just crazy to see if a man can't be captain in his own claim. These
children must go to school. They must all go&mdash;the darned lot
of 'em."</p>

<h2><a name="SIXTH_CHAPTER" id="SIXTH_CHAPTER"></a>SIXTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Before I speak of what happened at school, I must say how and
when I first became known to the doctor's boy.</p>
<p>It was during the previous Christmastide. On Christmas Eve I
awoke in the dead of night with the sense of awakening in another
world. The church-bells were ringing, and there was singing outside
our house, under the window of my mother's room. After listening
for a little while I made my voice as soft as I could and said:</p>
<p>"Mamma, what is it'?"</p>
<p>"Hush, dear! It is the Waits. Lie still and listen," said my
mother.</p>
<p>I lay as long as my patience would permit, and then creeping
over to the window I saw a circle of men and women, with lanterns,
and the frosty air smoking about their red faces. After a while
they stopped singing, and then the chain of our front door rattled,
and I heard my father's loud voice asking the singers into the
house.</p>
<p>They came in, and when I was back in bed, I heard them talking
and then laughing in the room below, with Aunt Bridget louder than
all the rest, and when I asked what she was doing my mother told me
she was serving out bunloaf and sherry-wine.</p>
<p>I fell asleep before the incident was over, but as soon as I
awoke in the morning I conceived the idea of singing the Waits
myself. Being an artful little thing I knew that my plan would be
opposed, so I said nothing about it, but I got my mother to play
and sing the carol I had heard overnight, until my quick ear had
mastered both tune and words, and when darkness fell on Christmas
night I proceeded to carry out my intention.</p>
<p>In the heat of my impatience I forgot to put on cloak or hat,
and stealing out of the house I found myself in the carriage drive
with nothing on but a pair of thin slippers and the velvet frock
that left my neck and arms so bare. It was snowing, and the
snow-flakes were whirling round me and making me dizzy, for in the
light from my mother's window they seemed to come up from the
ground as well as down from the sky.</p>
<p>When I got out of the light of the window, it was very dark, and
I could only see that the chestnuts in the drive seemed to have
white blankets on them which looked as if they had been hung out to
dry. It was a long time before I got to the gate, and then I had
begun to be nervous and to have half a mind to turn back. But the
thought of the bunloaf and the sherry-wine buoyed me up, and
presently I found myself on the high road, crossing a bridge and
turning down a lane that led to the sea, whose moaning a mile away
was the only sound I could hear.</p>
<p>I knew quite well where I was going to. I was going to the
doctor's house. It was called Sunny Lodge, and it was on the edge
of Yellow Gorse Farm. I had seen it more than once when I had
driven out in the carriage with my mother, and had thought how
sweet it looked with its whitewashed walls and brown thatched roof
and the red and white roses which grew over the porch.</p>
<p>I was fearfully cold before I got there. The snow was in my
slippers and down my neck and among the thickening masses of my
hair. At one moment I came upon some sheep and lambs that were
sheltering under a hedge, and they bleated in the silence of the
night.</p>
<p>But at last I saw the warm red windows of the doctor's cottage,
and coming to the wicket gate, I pushed it open though it was
clogged with snow, and stepped up to the porch. My teeth were now
chattering with cold, but as well as I could I began to sing, and
in my thin and creachy voice I had got as far as&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Ch'ist was born in Bef-lem,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ch'ist was born in
Bef-lem,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Ch'ist was born in
Bef-lem,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">An' in a manger laid. . .
."</span><br /></i></p>
<p>when I heard a rumbling noise inside the house.</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards the door was opened upon me, and a woman
whom I knew to be the doctor's wife looked down into my face with
an expression of bewilderment, and then cried:</p>
<p>"Goodness gracious me, doctor&mdash;if it isn't little Mary
O'Neill, God bless her!"</p>
<p>"Bring her in at once, then," said the voice of Doctor Conrad
from within, and at the next moment I found myself in a sort of
kitchen-parlour which was warm with a glowing turf fire that had a
kettle singing over it, and cosy and bright with a ragwork
hearth-rug, a dresser full of blue pottery and a sofa settle
covered with red cloth.</p>
<p>I suppose the sudden change to a warm room must have caused me
to faint, for I have no recollection of what happened next, except
that I was sitting on somebody's lap and that she was calling me
<i>boght millish</i> (little sweet) and <i>veg-veen</i> (little
dear) while she rubbed my half-frozen limbs and did other things
that were, I am sure, all womanly and good.</p>
<p>When I came to myself Doctor Conrad was saying I would have to
sleep there that night, and he must go over to the Big House and
tell my mother what had happened. He went, and by the time he came
back, I had been bathed in a dolly-tub placed in front of the fire,
and was being carried upstairs (in a nightdress many sizes too
large for me) to a little dimity-white bedroom, where the sweet
smelling "scraas" under the sloping thatch of the roof came down
almost to my face.</p>
<p>I know nothing of what happened during the night, except that I
was feeling very hot, and that as often as I opened my eyes the
doctor's wife was leaning over me and speaking in a soft voice that
seemed far away. But next day I felt cooler and then Aunt Bridget
came in her satin mantle and big black hat, and said something,
while standing at the end of my bed, about people paying the
penalty when they did things that were sly and underhand.</p>
<p>Towards evening I was much easier, and when the doctor came in
to see me at night he said:</p>
<p>"How are we this evening? Ah, better, I see. Distinctly
better!"</p>
<p>And then turning to his wife he said:</p>
<p>"No need to stay up with her to-night, Christian Ann."</p>
<p>"But won't the <i>boght millish</i> be afraid to be left alone?"
she asked.</p>
<p>I said I shouldn't, and she kissed me and told me to knock at
the wall if I wanted anything. And then, with her husband's arm
about her waist, the good soul left me to myself.</p>
<p>I don't know how I knew, but I did know that that house was a
home of love. I don't know how I knew, but I did know, that that
sweet woman, who had been the daughter of a well-to-do man, had
chosen the doctor out of all the men in the world when he was only
a medical student fresh from Germany or Switzerland. I don't know
how I knew, but I did know, that leaving father and mother and a
sheltered home she had followed her young husband when he first
came to Ellan without friends or connections, and though poor then
and poor still, she had never regretted it. I don't know how I
knew, but I did know, that all this was the opposite of what had
happened to my own dear mother, who having everything yet had
nothing, while this good creature having nothing yet had all.</p>

<h2><a name="SEVENTH_CHAPTER" id="SEVENTH_CHAPTER"></a>SEVENTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>When I awoke next morning the sun was shining, and, after my
hair had been brushed smooth over my forehead, I was sitting up in
bed, eating for breakfast the smallest of bantam eggs with the
smallest of silver spoons, when the door opened with a bang and a
small figure tumbled into my room.</p>
<p>It was a boy, two years older than myself. He wore a grey
Norfolk jacket and knickerbockers, but the peculiarity of his dress
was a white felt hat of enormous size, which, being soiled and
turned down in the brim, and having a hole in the crown with a crop
of his brown hair sticking through it, gave him the appearance of a
damaged mushroom.</p>
<p>Except that on entering he tipped up his head so that I saw his
face, which was far from beautiful and yet had two big blue
eyes&mdash;as blue as the bluest sea&mdash;he took no notice of my
presence, but tossed a somersault in the middle of the floor,
screwed his legs over the back of a chair, vaulted over a table and
finally stood on his hands with his legs against the wall opposite
to my bed, and his inverted countenance close to the carpet.</p>
<p>In this position, in which he was clearly making a point of
remaining as long as possible, while his face grew very red, we
held our first conversation. I had hitherto sat propped up as quiet
as a mouse, but now I said:</p>
<p>"Little boy, what's your name?"</p>
<p>"Mart," was the answer.</p>
<p>"Where do you come from?"</p>
<p>"Spitzbergen."</p>
<p>I cannot remember that this intelligence astonished me, for when
the inverted face had become scarlet, and the legs went down and
the head came up, and my visitor tossed several somersaults over
the end of my bed, to the danger of my breakfast tray, and then,
without a word more, tumbled out of the room, I was still watching
in astonishment.</p>
<p>I did not know at that time that these were the ways which since
the beginning of the world have always been employed by savages and
boys when they desire to commend themselves to the female of their
kind, so that when the doctor's wife came smiling upstairs I asked
her if the little boy who had been to see me was not quite
well.</p>
<p>"Bless you, yes, dear, but that's his way," she said, and then
she told me all about him.</p>
<p>His name was Martin Conrad and he was her only child. His hat,
which had awakened my interest, was an old one of his father's, and
it was the last thing he took off when he undressed for bed at
night and the first thing he put on in the morning. When the hole
came into its crown his mother had tried to hide it away but he had
always found it, and when she threw it into the river he had fished
it out again.</p>
<p>He was the strangest boy, full of the funniest fancies. He used
to say that before he was born he lived in a tree and was the
fellow who turned on the rain. It was with difficulty that he could
be educated, and every morning on being awakened, he said he was
"sorry he ever started this going to school." As a consequence he
could not read or write as well as other boys of his age, and his
grammar was still that of the peasant people with whom he loved to
associate.</p>
<p>Chief among these was our gardener, old Tommy the Mate, who
lived in a mud cabin on the shore and passed the doctor's house on
his way to work. Long ago Tommy had told the boy a tremendous
story. It was about Arctic exploration and an expedition he had
joined in search of Franklin. This had made an overpowering
impression on Martin, who for mouths afterwards would stand waiting
at the gate until Tommy was going by, and then say:</p>
<p>"Been to the North Pole to-day, Tommy?"</p>
<p>Whereupon Tommy's "starboard eye" would blink and he would
answer:</p>
<p>"Not to-day boy. I don't go to the North Pole more nor twice a
day now."</p>
<p>"Don't you, though?" the boy would say, and this would happen
every morning.</p>
<p>But later on Martin conceived the idea that the North Pole was
the locality immediately surrounding his father's house, and every
day he would set out on voyages of exploration over the garden, the
road and the shore, finding, by his own account, a vast world of
mysterious things and undiscovered places. By some
means&mdash;nobody knew how&mdash;the boy who could not learn his
lessons studied his father's German atlas, and there was not a name
in it north of Spitzbergen which he had not got by heart. He
transferred them all to Ellan, so that the Sky Hill became
Greenland, and the Black Head became Franz Josef Land, and the
Nun's Well became Behring Strait, and Martha's Gullet became New
Siberia, and St. Mary's Rock, with the bell anchored on it, became
the pivot of the earth itself.</p>
<p>He could swim like a fish and climb a rock like a lizard, and he
kept a log-book, on the back pages of the Doctor's book of visits,
which he called his "diarrhea." And now if you lost him you had
only to look up to the ridge of the roof, or perhaps on to the
chimney stack, which he called his crow's nest, and there you found
him, spying through his father's telescope and crying out:</p>
<p>"Look-out ahead! Ice floes from eighty-six latitude fourteen
point north, five knots to the starboard bow."</p>
<p>His mother laughed until she cried when she told me all this,
but there is no solemnity like that of a child, and to me it was a
marvellous story. I conceived a deep admiration for the doctor's
boy, and saw myself with eyes of worship walking reverently by his
side. I suppose my poor lonely heart was hungering after
comradeship, for being a sentimental little ninny I decided to
offer myself to the doctor's boy as his sister.</p>
<p>The opportunity was dreadfully long in coming. It did not come
until the next morning, when the door of my room flew open with a
yet louder bang than before, and the boy entered in a soap-box on
wheels, supposed to be a sledge, and drawn by a dog, an Irish
terrier, which being red had been called William Rufus. His hat was
tied over his ears with a tape from his mother's apron, and he wore
a long pair of his father's knitted stockings which covered his
boots and came up to his thighs.</p>
<p>He did not at first take any more notice of me than on the
previous day, but steering his sledge round the room he shouted to
his dog that the chair by the side of my bed was a glacier and the
sheep-skin rug was floating ice.</p>
<p>After a while we began to talk, and then, thinking my time had
come, I tried to approach my subject. Being such a clever little
woman I went artfully to work, speaking first about my father, my
mother, my cousin, Nessy MacLeod, and even Aunt Bridget, with the
intention of showing how rich I was in relations, so that he might
see how poor he was himself.</p>
<p>I felt myself a bit of a hypocrite in all this, but the doctor's
boy did not know that, and I noticed that as I passed my people in
review he only said "Is she any good?" or "Is he a stunner?"</p>
<p>At length my great moment came and with a fluttering heart I
took it.</p>
<p>"Haven't you got a sister?" I said.</p>
<p>"Not <i>me</i>!" said the doctor's boy, with a dig of emphasis
on the last word which cut me to the quick.</p>
<p>"Wouldn't you like to have one?"</p>
<p>"Sisters isn't no good," said the doctor's boy, and he instanced
"chaps" at school&mdash;Jimmy Christopher and others&mdash;whose
sisters were afraid of everything&mdash;lobsters and crabs and even
the sea.</p>
<p>I knew I was as timid as a hare myself, but my lonely little
heart was beginning to bleed, and as well as I could for my throat
which was choking me, I said:</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of the sea&mdash;not crabs neither."</p>
<p>In a moment the big mushroom hat was tipped aside and the
sea-blue eyes looked aslant at me.</p>
<p>"Isn't you, though?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>That did it. I could see it did. And when a minute afterwards, I
invited the doctor's boy into bed, he came in, stockings and all,
and sat by my right side, while William Rufus, who had formed an
instant attachment for me, lay on my left with his muzzle on my
lap.</p>
<p>Later the same day, my bedroom door being open, so that I might
call downstairs to the kitchen, I heard the doctor's boy telling
his mother what I was. I was a "stunner."</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="EIGHTH_CHAPTER" id="EIGHTH_CHAPTER"></a>EIGHTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>From that day forward the doctor's boy considered that I
belonged to him, but not until I was sent to school, with my cousin
and her stepsister, did he feel called upon to claim his
property.</p>
<p>It was a mixed day-school in the village, and it was controlled
by a Board which had the village butcher as its chairman. The only
teacher was a tall woman of thirty, who plaited her hair, which was
of the colour of flax, into a ridiculous-looking crown on the top
of her head. But her expression, I remember, was one of perpetual
severity, and when she spoke through her thin lips she clipped her
words with great rapidity, as if they had been rolls of bread which
were being chopped in a charity school.</p>
<p>Afterwards I heard that she owed her position to Aunt Bridget,
who had exercised her influence through the chairman, by means of
his account with the Big House. Perhaps she thought it her duty to
display her gratitude. Certainly she lost no time in showing me
that my character had gone to school before me, for in order that I
might be directly under her eye, she placed me in the last seat in
the lowest class, although my mother's daily teaching would have
entitled me to go higher.</p>
<p>I dare say I was, as Father Dan used to say, as full of mischief
as a goat, and I know I was a chatterbox, but I do not think I
deserved the fate that followed.</p>
<p>One day, not more than a week after we had been sent to school.
I held my slate in front of my face while I whispered something to
the girl beside and the girl behind me. Both began to titter.</p>
<p>"Silence!" cried the schoolmistress, who was sitting at her
desk, but I went on whispering and the girls began to choke with
laughter.</p>
<p>I think the schoolmistress must have thought I was saying
something about herself&mdash;making game, perhaps, of her personal
appearance&mdash;for after a moment she said, in her rapid
accents:</p>
<p>"Mary O'Neill, please repeat what you have just been
saying."</p>
<p>I held my slate yet closer to my face and made no answer.</p>
<p>"Don't you hear, miss? Speak! You've a tongue in your head,
haven't you?"</p>
<p>But still I did not answer, and then the schoolmistress
said:</p>
<p>"Mary O'Neill, come forward."</p>
<p>She had commanded me like a dog, and like a dog I was about to
obey when I caught sight of Betsy Beauty's face, which, beaming
with satisfaction, seemed to be saying: "Now, we shall see."</p>
<p>I would not stir after that, and the schoolmistress, leaving her
desk, came towards me, and looking darkly into my face, said:</p>
<p>"You wilful little vixen, do you think you can trifle with me?
Come out, miss, this very moment."</p>
<p>I knew where that language came from, so I made no movement.</p>
<p>"Don't you hear? Or do you suppose that because you are pampered
and spoiled by a foolish person at home, you can defy
<i>me</i>?"</p>
<p>That reflection on my mother settled everything. I sat as rigid
as a rock.</p>
<p>Then pale as a whitewashed wall, and with her thin lips tightly
compressed, the schoolmistress took hold of me to drag me out of my
seat, but with my little nervous fingers I clung to the desk in
front of me, and as often as she tore one of my hands open the
other fixed itself afresh.</p>
<p>"You minx! We'll see who's mistress here. . . . Will none of you
big girls come and help me?"</p>
<p>With the utmost alacrity one big girl from a back bench came
rushing to the schoolmistress' assistance. It was Nessy MacLeod,
and together, after a fierce struggle, they tore me from my desk,
like an ivy branch from a tree, and dragged me into the open space
in front of the classes. By this time the schoolmistress' hands,
and I think her neck were scratched, and from that cause also she
was quivering with passion.</p>
<p>"Stand there, miss," she said, "and move from that spot at your
peril."</p>
<p>My own fury was now spent, and in the dead silence which had
fallen on the entire school, I was beginning to feel the shame of
my ignominious position.</p>
<p>"Children," cried the schoolmistress, addressing the whole of
the scholars, "put down your slates and listen."</p>
<p>Then, as soon as she had recovered her breath she said, standing
by my side and pointing down to me:</p>
<p>"This child came to school with the character of a wilful,
wicked little vixen, and she has not belied her character. By gross
disobedience she has brought herself to where you see her. 'Spare
the rod, spoil the child,' is a scriptural maxim, and the foolish
parents who ruin their children by overindulgence deserve all that
comes to them. But there is no reason why other people should
suffer, and, small as this child is she has made the life of her
excellent aunt intolerable by her unlovable, unsociable, and
unchildlike disposition. Children, she was sent to school to be
corrected of her faults, and I order you to stop your lessons while
she is publicly punished. . . ."</p>
<p>With this parade of the spirit of justice, the schoolmistress
stepped back and left me. I knew what she was doing&mdash;she was
taking her cane out of her desk which stood by the wall. I heard
the desk opened with an impatient clash and then closed with an
angry bang. I was as sure as if I had had eyes in the back of my
head, that the schoolmistress was holding the cane in both hands
and bending it to see if it was lithe and limber.</p>
<p>I felt utterly humiliated. Standing there with all eyes upon me
I was conscious of the worst pain that enters into a child's
experience&mdash;the pain of knowing that other children are
looking upon her degradation. I thought of Aunt Bridget and my
little heart choked with anger. Then I thought of my mother and my
throat throbbed with shame. I remembered what my mother had said,
of her little Mary being always a little lady, and I felt crushed
at the thought that I was about to be whipped before all the
village children.</p>
<p>At home I had been protected if only by my mother's tears, but
here I was alone, and felt myself to be so little and helpless. But
just as my lip was beginning to drop, at the thought of what my
mother would suffer if she saw me in this position of infamy, and I
was about to cry out to the schoolmistress: "Don't beat me! Oh!
please don't beat me!" a strange thing happened, which turned my
shame into surprise and triumph.</p>
<p>Through the mist which had gathered before my eyes I saw a boy
coming out of the boys' class at the end of the long room. It was
Martin Conrad, and I remember that he rolled as he walked like old
Tommy the gardener. Everybody saw him, and the schoolmistress said
in her sharp voice:</p>
<p>"Martin Conrad, what right have you to leave your place without
permission? Go back, sir, this very moment."</p>
<p>Instead of going back Martin came on, and as he did so he
dragged his big soft hat out of the belt of his Norfolk jacket and
with both hands pulled it down hard on his head.</p>
<p>"Go back, sir!" cried the schoolmistress, and I saw her step
towards him with the cane poised and switching in the air, as if
about to strike.</p>
<p>The boy said nothing, but just shaking himself like a big dog he
dropped his head and butted at the schoolmistress as she approached
him, struck her somewhere in the waist and sent her staggering and
gasping against the wall.</p>
<p>Then, without a word, he took my hand, as something that
belonged to him, and before the schoolmistress could recover her
breath, or the scholars awake from their astonishment, he marched
me, as if his little stocky figure had been sixteen feet tall, in
stately silence out of the school.</p>

<h2><a name="NINTH_CHAPTER" id="NINTH_CHAPTER"></a>NINTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I was never sent back to school, and I heard that Martin, by
order of the butcher, was publicly expelled. This was a cause of
distress to our mothers, who thought the future of our lives had
been permanently darkened, but I cannot say that it ever stood
between us and our sunshine. On the contrary it occurred
that&mdash;Aunt Bridget having washed her hands of me, and Martin's
father being unable to make up his mind what to do with
him&mdash;we found ourselves for some time at large and were
nothing loth to take advantage of our liberty, until a day came
which brought a great disaster.</p>
<p>One morning I found Martin with old Tommy the Mate in his
potting-shed, deep in the discussion of their usual
subject&mdash;the perils and pains of Arctic exploration, when you
have little food in your wallet and not too much in your
stomach.</p>
<p>"But you has lots of things when you gets there&mdash;hams and
flitches and oranges and things&mdash;hasn't you?" said Martin.</p>
<p>"Never a ha'p'orth," said Tommy. "Nothing but glory. You just
takes your Alping stock and your sleeping sack and your bit o'
biscuit and away you go over crevaxes deeper nor Martha's gullet
and mountains higher nor Mount Blank and never think o' nothing but
doing something that nobody's never done before. My goodness, yes,
boy, that's the way of it when you're out asploring. 'Glory's
waiting for me' says you, and on you go."</p>
<p>At that great word I saw Martin's blue eyes glisten like the sea
when the sun is shining on it; and then, seeing me for the first
time, he turned back to old Tommy and said:</p>
<p>"I s'pose you lets women go with you when you're out
asploring&mdash;women and girls?"</p>
<p>"Never a woman," said Tommy.</p>
<p>"Not never&mdash;not if they're stunners?" said Martin.</p>
<p>"Well," says Tommy, glancing down at me, while his starboard eye
twinkled, "I won't say never&mdash;not if they're stunners."</p>
<p>Next day Martin, attended by William Rufus, arrived at our house
with a big corn sack on his shoulder, a long broom-handle in his
hand, a lemonade bottle half filled with milk, a large sea biscuit
and a small Union Jack which came from the confectioner's on the
occasion of his last birthday.</p>
<p>"Glory's waiting for me&mdash;come along, shipmate," he said in
a mysterious whisper, and without a word of inquiry, I obeyed.</p>
<p>He gave me the biscuit and I put it in the pocket of my frock,
and the bottle of milk, and I tied it to my belt, and then off we
went, with the dog bounding before us.</p>
<p>I knew he was going to the sea, and my heart was in my mouth,
for of all the things I was afraid of I feared the sea most&mdash;a
terror born with me, perhaps, on the fearful night of my birth. But
I had to live up to the character I had given myself when Martin
became my brother, and the one dread of my life was that, finding
me as timid as other girls, he might want me no more.</p>
<p>We reached the sea by a little bay, called Murphy's Mouth, which
had a mud cabin that stood back to the cliff and a small boat that
was moored to a post on the shore. Both belonged to Tommy the Mate,
who was a "widow man" living alone, and therefore there were none
to see us when we launched the boat and set out on our voyage. It
was then two o'clock in the afternoon, the sun was shining, and the
tide, which was at the turn, was beginning to flow.</p>
<p>I had never been in a boat before, but I dared not say anything
about that, and after Martin had fixed the bow oar for me and taken
the stroke himself, I spluttered and plunged and made many
blunders. I had never been on the sea either, and almost as soon as
we shot clear of the shore and were lifted on to the big waves, I
began to feel dizzy, and dropped my oar, with the result that it
slipped through the rollocks and was washed away. Martin saw what
had happened as we swung round to his rowing, but when I expected
him to scold me, he only said:</p>
<p>"Never mind, shipmate! I was just thinking we would do better
with one," and, shipping his own oar in the stern of the boat, he
began to scull.</p>
<p>My throat was hurting me, and partly from shame and partly from
fear, I now sat forward, with William Rufus on my lap, and said as
little as possible. But Martin was in high spirits, and while his
stout little body rolled to the rocking of the boat he whistled and
sang and shouted messages to me over his shoulder.</p>
<p>"My gracious! Isn't this what you call ripping?" he cried, and
though my teeth were chattering, I answered that it was.</p>
<p>"Some girls&mdash;Jimmy Christopher's sister and Nessy MacLeod
and Betsy Beauty&mdash;would be frightened to come asploring,
wouldn't they?"</p>
<p>"Wouldn't they?" I said, and I laughed, though I was trembling
down to the soles of my shoes.</p>
<p>We must have been half an hour out, and the shore seemed so far
away that Murphy's Mouth and Tommy's cabin and even the trees of
the Big House looked like something I had seen through the wrong
end of a telescope, when he turned his head, with a wild light in
his eyes, and said:</p>
<p>"See the North Pole out yonder?"</p>
<p>"Don't I?" I answered, though I was such a practical little
person, and had not an ounce of "dream" in me.</p>
<p>I knew quite well where he was going to. He was going to St.
Mary's Rock, and of all the places on land or sea, it was the place
I was most afraid of, being so big and frowning, an ugly black
mass, standing twenty to thirty feet out of the water, draped like
a coffin in a pall, with long fronds of sea-weed, and covered, save
at high water, by a multitude of hungry sea-fowl.</p>
<p>A white cloud of the birds rose from their sleep as we
approached, and wheeled and whistled and screamed and beat their
wings over our heads. I wanted to scream too, but Martin said:</p>
<p>"My gracious, isn't this splendiferous?"</p>
<p>"Isn't it?" I answered, and, little hypocrite that I was, I
began to sing.</p>
<p>I remember that I sang one of Tommy's sailor-songs, "Sally,"
because its jolly doggerel was set to such a jaunty tune&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Oh Sally's the gel for me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Our Sally's the gel for
me,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I'll marry the gel that I love
best</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When I come back from
sea."</span><br /></i></p>
<p>My pretence of happiness was shortlived, for at the next moment
I made another mistake. Drawing up his boat to a ledge of the rock,
and laying hold of our painter, Martin leapt ashore, and then held
out his hand to me to follow him, but in fear of a big wave I held
back when I ought to have jumped, and he was drenched from head to
foot. I was ashamed, and thought he would have scolded me, but he
only shook himself and said:</p>
<p>"That's nothing! We don't mind a bit of wet when we're out
asploring."</p>
<p>My throat was hurting me again and I could not speak, but
without waiting for me to answer he coiled the rope about my right
arm, and told me to stay where I was, and hold fast to the boat,
while he climbed the rock and took possession of it in the name of
the king.</p>
<p>"Do or die we allus does that when we're out asploring," he
said, and with his sack over his shoulder, his broom-handle in his
hand and his little Union Jack sticking out of the hole in the
crown of his hat, he clambered up the crag and disappeared over the
top of it.</p>
<p>Being left alone, for the dog had followed him, my nervousness
increased tenfold, and thinking at last that the rising tide was
about to submerge the ledge on which I stood, I tried in my fright
to climb the cliff. But hardly had I taken three steps when my foot
slipped and I clutched the seaweed to save myself from falling,
with the result that the boat's rope slid from my arm, and went
rip-rip-ripping down the rock until it fell with a splash into the
sea.</p>
<p>I saw what I had done, and I screamed, and then Martin's head
appeared after a moment on the ledge above me. But it was too late
for him to do anything, for the boat had already drifted six yards
away, and just when I thought he would have shrieked at me for
cutting off our only connection with the shore, he said:</p>
<p>"Never mind, shipmate! We allus expecs to lose a boat or two
when we're out asploring."</p>
<p>I was silent from shame, but Martin, having hauled me up the
rock by help of the broom handle, rattled away as if nothing had
happened&mdash;pointing proudly to a rust-eaten triangle with a
bell suspended inside of it and his little flag floating on
top.</p>
<p>"But, oh dear, what are we to do now?" I whimpered.</p>
<p>"Don't you worrit about that," he said. "We'll just signal back
to the next base&mdash;we call them bases when we're out
asploring."</p>
<p>I understood from this that he was going to ring the bell which,
being heard on the land, would bring somebody to our relief. But
the bell was big, only meant to be put in motion on stormy nights
by the shock and surging of an angry sea, and when Martin had tied
a string to its tongue it was a feeble sound he struck from it.</p>
<p>Half an hour passed, an hour, two hours, and still I saw nothing
on the water but our own empty boat rocking its way back to the
shore.</p>
<p>"Will they ever come?" I faltered.</p>
<p>"Ra&mdash;ther! Just you wait and you'll see them coming. And
when they take us ashore there'll be crowds and crowds with bugles
and bands and things to take us home. My goodness, yes," he said,
with the same wild look, "hundreds and tons of them!"</p>
<p>But the sun set over the sea behind us, the land in front grew
dim, the moaning tide rose around the quaking rock and even the
screaming sea-fowl deserted us, and still there was no sign of
relief. My heart was quivering through my clothes by this time, but
Martin, who had whistled and sung, began to talk about being
hungry.</p>
<p>"My goodness yes, I'm that hungry I could eat. . . . I could eat
a dog&mdash;we allus eats our dogs when we're out asploring."</p>
<p>This reminded me of the biscuit, but putting my hand to the
pocket of my frock I found to my dismay that it was gone, having
fallen out, perhaps, when I slipped in my climbing. My lip fell and
I looked up at him with eyes of fear, but he only said:</p>
<p>"No matter! We never minds a bit of hungry when we're out
asploring."</p>
<p>I did not know then, what now I know, that my little boy who
could not learn his lessons and had always been in disgrace, was a
born gentleman, but my throat was thick and my eyes were swimming
and to hide my emotion I pretended to be ill.</p>
<p>"I know," said Martin. "Dizzingtory! [dysentery]. We allus has
dizzingtory when we're out asploring."</p>
<p>There was one infallible cure for that, though&mdash;milk!</p>
<p>"I allus drinks a drink of milk, and away goes the dizzingtory
in a jiffy."</p>
<p>This recalled the bottle, but when I twisted it round on my
belt, hoping to make amends for the lost biscuit, I found to my
confusion that it had suffered from the same misadventure, being
cracked in the bottom, and every drop of the contents gone.</p>
<p>That was the last straw, and the tears leapt to my eyes, but
Martin went on whistling and singing and ringing the big bell as if
nothing had happened.</p>
<p>The darkness deepened, the breath of night came sweeping over
the sea, the boom of the billows on the rock became still more
terrible, and I began to shiver.</p>
<p>"The sack!" cried Martin. "We allus sleeps in sacks when we're
out asploring."</p>
<p>I let him do what he liked with me now, but when he had packed
me up in the sack, and put me to lie at the foot of the triangle,
telling me I was as right as ninepence, I began to think of
something I had read in a storybook, and half choking with sobs I
said:</p>
<p>"Martin!"</p>
<p>"What now, shipmate?"</p>
<p>"It's all my fault . . . and I'm just as frightened as Jimmy
Christopher's sister and Nessy MacLeod and Betsy Beauty . . . and
I'm not a stunner . . . and you'll have to give me up . . . and
leave me here and save yourself and . . ."</p>
<p>But Martin stopped me with a shout and a crack of laughter.</p>
<p>"Not <i>me</i>! Not much! We never leaves a pal when we're out
asploring. Long as we lives we never does it. Not never!"</p>
<p>That finished me. I blubbered like a baby, and William Rufus,
who was sitting by my side, lifted his nose and joined in my
howling.</p>
<p>What happened next I never rightly knew. I was only aware,
though my back was to him, that Martin, impatient of his string,
had leapt up to the bell and was swinging his little body from the
tongue to make a louder clamour. One loud clang I heard, and then
came a crash and a crack, and then silence.</p>
<p>"What is it?" I cried, but at first there was no answer.</p>
<p>"Have you hurt yourself?"</p>
<p>And then through the thunderous boom of the rising sea on the
rock, came the breaking voice of my boy (he had broken his right
arm) mingled with the sobs which his unconquered and unconquerable
little soul was struggling to suppress&mdash;</p>
<p>"We never minds a bit of hurt . . . we never minds
<i>nothing</i> when we're out asploring!"</p>
<p>Meantime on shore there was a great commotion. My father was
railing at Aunt Bridget, who was upbraiding my mother, who was
crying for Father Dan, who was flying off for Doctor Conrad, who
was putting his horse into his gig and scouring the parish in
search of the two lost children.</p>
<p>But Tommy the Mate, who remembered the conversation in the
potting-shed and thought he heard the tinkle of a bell at sea,
hurried off to the shore, where he found his boat bobbing on the
beach, and thereby came to his own conclusions.</p>
<p>By the light of a lantern he pulled out to St. Mary's Rock, and
there, guided by the howling of the dog, he came upon the great
little explorers, hardly more than three feet above high water,
lying together in the corn sack, locked in each other's arms and
fast asleep.</p>
<p>There were no crowds and bands of music waiting for us when
Tommy brought us ashore, and after leaving Martin with his broken
limb in his mother's arms at the gate of Sunny Lodge, he took me
over to the Presbytery in order that Father Dan might carry me home
and so stand between me and my father's wrath and Aunt Bridget's
birch.</p>
<p>Unhappily there was no need for this precaution. The Big House,
when we reached it, was in great confusion. My mother had broken a
blood vessel.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="TENTH_CHAPTER" id="TENTH_CHAPTER"></a>TENTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>During the fortnight in which my mother was confined to bed I
was her constant companion and attendant. With the mighty eagerness
of a child who knew nothing of what the solemn time foreboded I
flew about the house on tiptoe, fetching my mother's medicine and
her milk and the ice to cool it, and always praising myself for my
industry and thinking I was quite indispensable.</p>
<p>"You couldn't do without your little Mally, could you, mammy?" I
would say, and my mother would smooth my hair lovingly with her
thin white hand and answer:</p>
<p>"No, indeed, I couldn't do without my little Mally." And then my
little bird-like beak would rise proudly in the air.</p>
<p>All this time I saw nothing of Martin, and only heard through
Doctor Conrad in his conversations with my mother, that the boy's
broken arm had been set, and that as soon as it was better, he was
to be sent to King George's College, which was at the other end of
Ellan. What was to be done with myself I never inquired, being so
satisfied that my mother could not get on without me.</p>
<p>I was partly aware that big letters, bearing foreign
postage-stamps and seals and coats of arms, with pictures of
crosses and hearts, were coming to our house. I was also aware that
at intervals, while my mother was in bed, there was the sound of
voices, as if in eager and sometimes heated conference, in the room
below, and that my mother would raise her pale face from her pillow
and stop my chattering with "Hush!" when my father's voice was
louder and sterner than usual. But it never occurred to me to
connect these incidents with myself, until the afternoon of the day
on which my mother got up for the first time.</p>
<p>She was sitting before the fire, for autumn was stealing on, and
I was bustling about her, fixing the rug about her knees and
telling her if she wanted anything she was to be sure and call her
little Mally, when a timid knock came to the door and Father Dan
entered the room. I can see his fair head and short figure still,
and hear his soft Irish voice, as he stepped forward and said:</p>
<p>"Now don't worry, my daughter. Above all, don't worry."</p>
<p>By long experience my mother knew this for a sign of the dear
Father's own perturbation, and I saw her lower lip tremble as she
asked:</p>
<p>"Hadn't Mary better run down to the garden?"</p>
<p>"No! Oh no!" said Father Dan. "It is about Mary I come to speak,
so our little pet may as well remain."</p>
<p>Then at a signal from my mother I went over to her and stood by
her side, and she embraced my waist with a trembling arm, while the
Father took a seat by her side, and, fumbling the little silver
cross on his chain, delivered his message.</p>
<p>After long and anxious thought&mdash;and he might say
prayer&mdash;it had been decided that I should be sent away to a
Convent. It was to be a Convent of the Sacred Heart in Rome. He was
to take me to Rome himself and see me safely settled there. And
they (meaning my father and Aunt Bridget) had promised
him&mdash;faithfully promised him&mdash;that when the holidays came
round he should be sent to bring me home again. So there was
nothing to fear, nothing to worry about, nothing to . . . to . .
.</p>
<p>My mother listened as long as she could, and then&mdash;her
beautiful white face distorted by pain&mdash;she broke in on the
Father's message with a cry of protest.</p>
<p>"But she is so young! Such a child! Only seven years old! How
can any one think of sending such a little one away from home?"</p>
<p>Father Dan tried to pacify her. It was true I was very young,
but then the Reverend Mother was such a good woman. She would love
me and care for me as if I were her own child. And then the good
nuns, God bless their holy souls. . . .</p>
<p>"But Mary is all I have," cried my mother, "and if they take her
away from me I shall be broken-hearted. At such a time too! How
cruel they are! They know quite well what the doctor says. Can't
they wait a little longer?"</p>
<p>I could see that Father Dan was arguing against himself, for his
eyes filled as he said:</p>
<p>"It's hard, I know it's hard for you, my daughter. But perhaps
it's best for the child that she should go away from
home&mdash;perhaps it's all God's blessed and holy will. Remember
there's a certain person here who isn't kind to our little
innocent, and is making her a cause of trouble. Not that I think
she is actuated by evil intentions. . . ."</p>
<p>"But she is, she is," cried my mother, who was growing more and
more excited.</p>
<p>"Then all the more reason why Mary should go to the
convent&mdash;for a time at all events."</p>
<p>My mother began to waver, and she said:</p>
<p>"Let her be sent to a Convent in the island then."</p>
<p>"I thought of that, but there isn't one," said Father Dan.</p>
<p>"Then . . . then . . . then take her to the Presbytery," said my
mother. "Dear, dear Father," she pleaded, "let her live with you,
and have somebody to teach her, and then she can come to see me
every day, or twice a week, or even once a week&mdash;I am not
unreasonable."</p>
<p>"It would be beautiful," said Father Dan, reaching over to touch
my arm. "To have our little Mary in my dull old house would be like
having the sun there always. But there are reasons why a young girl
should not be brought up in the home of a priest, so it is better
that our little precious should go to Rome."</p>
<p>My mother was breaking down and Father Dan followed up his
advantage.</p>
<p>"Then wisha, my daughter, think what a good thing it will be for
the child. She will be one of the children of the Infant Jesus
first, then a child of Mary, and then of the Sacred heart itself.
And then remember, Rome! The holy city! The city of the Holy
Father! Why, who knows, she may even see himself some day!"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I know," said my mother, and then turning with her
melting eyes to me she said:</p>
<p>"Would my Mary like to go&mdash;leaving her mamma but coming
home in the holidays&mdash;would she?"</p>
<p>I was going to say I would not, because mamma could not possibly
get on without me, but before I could reply Aunt Bridget, with her
bunch of keys at her waist, came jingling into the room, and
catching my mother's last words, said, in her harsh, high-pitched
voice.</p>
<p>"Isabel! You astonish me! To defer to the will of a child! Such
a child too! So stubborn and spoiled and self-willed! If <i>we</i>
say it is good for her to go she <i>must</i> go!"</p>
<p>I could feel through my mother's arm, which was still about my
waist, that she was trembling from head to foot, but at first she
did not speak and Aunt Bridget, in her peremptory way, went on:</p>
<p>"We say it is good for you, too, Isabel, if she is not to hasten
your death by preying on your nerves and causing you to break more
blood vessels. So we are consulting your welfare as well as the
girl's in sending her away."</p>
<p>My mother's timid soul could bear no more. I think it must have
been the only moment of anger her gentle spirit ever knew, but,
gathering all her strength, she turned upon Aunt Bridget in
ungovernable excitement.</p>
<p>"Bridget," she said, "you are doing nothing of the kind. You
know you are not. You are only trying to separate me from my child
and my child from me. When you came to my house I thought you would
be kinder to my child than a anybody else, but you have not been,
you have been cruel to her, and shut your heart against her, and
while I have been helpless here, and in bed, you have never shown
her one moment of love and kindness. No, you have no feeling except
for your own, and it never occurs to you that having brought your
own child into my house you are trying to turn my child out of
it."</p>
<p>"So that's how you look at it, is it?" said Aunt Bridget, with a
flash of her cold grey eyes. "I thought I came to this
house&mdash;your house as you call it&mdash;only out of the best
intentions, just to spare you trouble when you were ill and unable,
to attend to your duties as a wife. But because I correct your
child when she is wilful and sly and wicked. . . ."</p>
<p>"Correct your own child, Bridget O'Neill!" cried my mother, "and
leave mine to me. She's all I have and it isn't long I shall have
her. You know quite well how much she has cost me, and that I
haven't had a very happy married life, but instead of helping me
with her father. . . ."</p>
<p>"Say no more," said Aunt Bridget, "we don't want you to hurt
yourself again, and to allow this ill-conditioned child to be the
cause of another hemorrhage."</p>
<p>"Bridget O'Neill," cried my mother, rising up from her chair,
"you are a hard-hearted woman with a bad disposition. You know as
well as I do that it wasn't Mary who made me ill, but
you&mdash;you, who reproached me and taunted me about my child
until my heart itself had to bleed. For seven years you have been
doing that, and now you are disposing of my darling over my head
without consulting me. Has a mother no rights in her own
child&mdash;the child she has suffered for, and loved and lived
for&mdash;that other people who care nothing for it should take it
away from her and send it into a foreign country where she may
never see it again? But you shall not do that! No, you shall not'!
As long as there's breath in my body you shall not do it, and if
you attempt. . . ."</p>
<p>In her wild excitement my mother had lifted one of her trembling
hands into Aunt Bridget's face while the other was still clasped
about me, when suddenly, with a look of fear on her face, she
stopped speaking. She had heard a heavy step on the stairs. It was
my father. He entered the room with his knotty forehead more
compressed than usual and said:</p>
<p>"What's this she shall not do?"</p>
<p>My mother dropped back into her seat in silence, and Aunt
Bridget, wiping' her eyes on her black apron&mdash;she only wept
when my father was present&mdash;proceeded to explain.</p>
<p>It seems I am a hard-hearted woman with a bad disposition and
though, I've been up early and late and made myself a servant for
seven years I'm only in this house to turn my sister's child out of
it. It seems too, that we have no business&mdash;none of us
have&mdash;to say what ought to be done for this girl&mdash;her
mother being the only person who has any rights in the child, and
if we attempt . . ."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>In his anger and impatience my father could listen no longer and
in his loud voice he said:</p>
<p>"Since when has a father lost control of his own daughter? He
has to provide for her, hasn't he? If she wants anything it's to
him she has to look for it, isn't it? That's the law I guess, eh?
Always has been, all the world over. Then what's all this hustling
about?"</p>
<p>My mother made a feeble effort to answer him.</p>
<p>"I was only saying, Daniel . . ."</p>
<p>"You were saying something foolish and stupid. I reckon a man
can do what he likes with his own, can't he? If this girl is my
child and I say she is to go somewhere, she is to go." And saying
this my father brought down his thick hand with a thump on to a
table.</p>
<p>It was the first time he had laid claim to me, and perhaps that
acted on my mother, as she said, submissively:</p>
<p>"Very well, dear. <i>You</i> know best what is best for Mary,
and if you say&mdash;you and Bridget and . . . and Father Dan. . .
."</p>
<p>"I do say, and that's enough. So just go to work and fix up this
Convent scheme without future notice. And hark here, let me see for
the future if a man can't have peace from these two-cent trifles
for his important business."</p>
<p>My mother was crushed. Her lips moved again, but she said
nothing aloud, and my father turned on his heel, and left the room,
shaking the floor at every step under the weight of his sixteen
stone. At the next moment, Aunt Bridget, jingling her keys, went
tripping after him.</p>
<p>Hardly had they gone when my mother broke into a long fit of
coughing, and when it was over she lay back exhausted, with her
white face and her tired eyes turned upwards. Then I clasped her
about the neck, and Father Dan, whose cheeks were wet with tears
patted her drooping hand.</p>
<p>My darling mother! Never once have I thought of her without the
greatest affection, but now that I know for myself what she must
have suffered I love best to think of her as she was that
day&mdash;my sweet, beautiful, timid angel&mdash;standing up for
one brief moment, not only against Aunt Bridget, but against the
cruelty of all the ages, in the divine right of her outraged
motherhood.</p>

<h2><a name="ELEVENTH_CHAPTER" id="ELEVENTH_CHAPTER"></a>ELEVENTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>My mother's submission was complete. Within twenty-four hours
she was busy preparing clothes for my journey to Rome. The old
coloured pattern book was brought out again, material was sent for,
a sewing-maid was engaged from the village, and above all, in my
view, an order was dispatched to Blackwater for a small
squirrel-skin scarf, a large squirrel-skin muff, and a
close-fitting squirrel-skin hat with a feather on the side of
it.</p>
<p>A child's heart is a running brook, and it would wrong the truth
to say that I grieved much in the midst of these busy preparations.
On the contrary I felt a sort of pride in them, poor innocent that
I was, as in something that gave me a certain high superiority over
Betsy Beauty and Nessy MacLeod, and entitled me to treat them with
condescension.</p>
<p>Father Dan, who came more frequently than ever, fostered this
feeling without intending to do so, by telling me, whenever we were
alone, that I must be a good girl to everybody now, and especially
to my mother.</p>
<p>"My little woman would be sorry to worry mamma, wouldn't she?"
he would whisper, and when I answered that I would be sorrier than
sorry, he would say:</p>
<p>"Wisha then, she must be brave. She must keep up. She must not
grieve about going away or cry when the time comes for
parting."</p>
<p>I said "yes" and "yes" to all this, feeling very confidential
and courageous, but I dare say the good Father gave the same
counsel to my mother also, for she and I had many games of
make-believe, I remember, in which we laughed and chattered and
sang, though I do not think I ever suspected that the part we
played was easier to me than to her.</p>
<p>It dawned on me at last, though, when in the middle of the
night, near to the time of my going away, I was awakened by a bad
fit of my mother's coughing, and heard her say to herself in the
deep breathing that followed:</p>
<p>"My poor child! What is to become of her?"</p>
<p>Nevertheless all went well down to the day of my departure. It
had been arranged that I was to sail to Liverpool by the first of
the two daily steamers, and without any awakening I leapt out of
bed at the first sign of daylight. So great was my delight that I
began to dance in my nightdress to an invisible skipping rope,
forgetting my father, who always rose at dawn and was at breakfast
in the room below.</p>
<p>My mother and I breakfasted in bed, and then there was great
commotion. It chiefly consisted for me in putting on my new
clothes, including my furs, and then turning round and round on
tiptoe and smiling at myself in a mirror. I was doing this while my
mother was telling me to write to her as often as I was allowed,
and while she knelt at her prayer stool, which she used as a desk,
to make a copy of the address for my letters.</p>
<p>Then I noticed that the first line of her superscription "Mrs.
Daniel O'Neill" was blurred by the tears that were dropping from
her eyes, and my throat began to hurt me dreadfully. But I
remembered what Father Dan had told me to do, so I said:</p>
<p>"Never mind, mammy. Don't worry&mdash;I'll be home for the
holidays."</p>
<p>Soon afterwards we heard the carriage wheels passing under the
window, and then Father Dan came up in a white knitted muffler, and
with a funny bag which he used for his surplice at funerals, and
said, through a little cloud of white breath, that everything was
ready.</p>
<p>I saw that my mother was turning round and taking out her
pocket-handkerchief, and I was snuffling a little myself, but at a
sign from Father Dan, who was standing at the threshold. I squeezed
back the water in my eyes and cried:</p>
<p>"Good-bye mammy. I'll be back for Christmas," and then darted
across to the door.</p>
<p>I was just passing through it when I heard my mother say "Mary"
in a strange low voice, and I turned and saw her&mdash;I can see
her still&mdash;with her beautiful pale face all broken up, and her
arms held out to me.</p>
<p>Then I rushed back to her, and she clasped me to her breast
crying, "Mally veen! My Mally veen!" and I could feel her heart
beating through her dress and hear the husky rattle in her throat,
and then all our poor little game of make-believe broke down
utterly.</p>
<p>At the next moment my father was calling upstairs that I should
be late for the steamer, so my mother dried her own eyes and then
mine, and let me go.</p>
<p>Father Dan was gone when I reached the head of the stairs but
seeing Nessy MacLeod and Betsy Beauty at the bottom of them I soon
recovered my composure, and sailing down in my finery I passed them
in stately silence with my little bird-like head in the air.</p>
<p>I intended to do the same with Aunt Bridget, who was standing
with a shawl over her shoulders by the open door, but she touched
me and said:</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to kiss me good-bye, then?"</p>
<p>"No," I answered, drawing my little body to its utmost
height.</p>
<p>"And why not?"</p>
<p>"Because you've been unkind to mamma and cruel to me, and
because you think there's nobody but Betsy Beauty. And I'll tell
them at the Convent that you are making mamma ill, and you're as
bad as . . . as bad as the bad women in the Bible!"</p>
<p>"My gracious!" said Aunt Bridget, and she tried to laugh, but I
could see that her face became as white as a whitewashed wall. This
did not trouble me in the least until I reached the carriage, when
Father Dan, who was sitting inside, said:</p>
<p>"My little Mary won't leave home like that&mdash;without kissing
her aunt and saying good-bye to her cousins."</p>
<p>So I returned and shook hands with Nessy MacLeod and Betsy
Beauty, and lifted my little face to my Aunt Bridget.</p>
<p>"That's better," she said, after she had kissed me, but when I
had passed her my quick little ear caught the words:</p>
<p>"Good thing she's going, though."</p>
<p>During this time my father, with the morning mist playing like
hoar-frost about his iron-grey hair, had been tramping the gravel
and saying the horses were getting cold, so without more ado he
bundled me into the carriage and banged the door on me.</p>
<p>But hardly had we started when Father Dan, who was blinking his
little eyes and pretending to blow his nose on his coloured print
handkerchief, said, "Look!" and pointed up to my mother's room.</p>
<p>There she was again, waving and kissing her hand to me through
her open window, and she continued to do so until we swirled round
some trees and I lost the sight of her.</p>
<p>What happened in my mother's room when her window was closed I
do not know, but I well remember that, creeping into a corner of
the carriage. I forgot all about the glory and grandeur of going
away, and that it did not help me to remember when half way down
the drive a boy with a dog darted from under the chestnuts and
raced alongside of us.</p>
<p>It was Martin, and though his right arm was in a sling, he leapt
up to the step and held on to the open window by his left hand
while he pushed his head into the carriage and made signs to me to
take out of his mouth a big red apple which he held in his teeth by
the stalk. I took it, and then he dropped to the ground, without
uttering a word, and I could laugh now to think of the gruesome
expression of his face with its lagging lower lip and bloodshot
eyes. I had no temptation to do so then, however, and least of all
when I looked back and saw his little one-armed figure in the big
mushroom hat, standing on the top of the high wall of the bridge,
with William Rufus beside him.</p>
<p>We reached Blackwater in good tithe for the boat, and when the
funnels had ceased trumpeting and we were well away, I saw that we
were sitting in one of two private cabins on the upper deck; and
then Father Dan told me that the other was occupied by the young
Lord Raa, and his guardian, and that they were going up together
for the first time to Oxford.</p>
<p>I am sure this did not interest me in the least at that moment,
so false is it that fate forewarns us when momentous events are
about to occur. And now that I had time to think, a dreadful truth
was beginning to dawn on me, so that when Father Dan, who was much
excited, went off to pay his respects to the great people, I
crudled up in the corner of the cabin that was nearest to the door
and told myself that after all I had been turned out of my father's
house, and would never see my mother and Martin any more.</p>
<p>I was sitting so, with my hands in my big muff and my face to
the stern, making the tiniest occasional sniff as the mountains of
my home faded away in the sunlight, which was now tipping the
hilltops with a feathery crest, when my cabin was darkened by
somebody who stood in the doorway.</p>
<p>It was a tail boy, almost a man, and I knew in a moment who he
was. He was the young Lord Raa. And at first I thought how handsome
and well dressed he was as he looked down at me and smiled. After a
moment he stepped into the cabin and sat in front of me and
said:</p>
<p>"So you are little Mary O'Neill, are you?"</p>
<p>I did not speak. I was thinking he was not so very handsome
after all, having two big front teeth like Betsy Beauty.</p>
<p>"The girl who ought to have been a boy and put my nose out,
eh?"</p>
<p>Still I did not speak. I was thinking his voice was like Nessy
MacLeod's&mdash;shrill and harsh and grating.</p>
<p>"Poor little mite! Going all the way to Rome to a Convent, isn't
she?"</p>
<p>Even yet I did not speak. I was thinking his eyes were like Aunt
Bridget's&mdash;cold and grey and piercing.</p>
<p>"So silent and demure, though! Quite a little nun already. A
deuced pretty one, too, if anybody asks me."</p>
<p>I was beginning to have a great contempt for him.</p>
<p>"Where did you get those big angel eyes from? Stole them from
some picture of the Madonna, I'll swear."</p>
<p>By this time I had concluded that he was not worth speaking to,
so I turned my head and I was looking back at the sea, when I heard
him say:</p>
<p>"I suppose you are going to give me a kiss, you nice little
woman, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Oh, but you must&mdash;we are relations, you know."</p>
<p>"I won't."</p>
<p>He laughed at that, and rising from his seat, he reached over to
kiss me, whereupon I drew one of my hands out of my muff and
doubling my little mittened fist, I struck him in the face.</p>
<p>Being, as I afterwards learned, a young autocrat, much indulged
by servants and generally tyrannising over them, he was surprised
and angry.</p>
<p>"The spitfire!" he said. "Who would have believed it? The face
of a nun and the temper of a devil! But you'll have to make amends
for this, my lady."</p>
<p>With that he went away and I saw no more of him until the
steamer was drawing up at the landing stage at Liverpool, and then,
while the passengers were gathering up their luggage, he came back
with Father Dan, and the tall sallow man who was his guardian, and
said:</p>
<p>"Going to give me that kiss to make amends, or are you to owe me
a grudge for the rest of your life, my lady?"</p>
<p>"My little Mary couldn't owe a grudge to anybody," said Father
Dan. "She'll kiss his lordship and make amends; I'm certain."</p>
<p>And then I did to the young Lord Raa what I had done to Aunt
Bridget&mdash;I held up my face and he kissed me.</p>
<p>It was a little, simple, trivial incident, but it led with other
things to the most lamentable fact of my life, and when I think of
it I sometimes wonder how it comes to pass that He who numbers the
flowers of the field and counts the sparrows as they fall has no
handwriting with which to warn His children that their footsteps
may not fail.</p>

<h2><a name="TWELFTH_CHAPTER" id="TWELFTH_CHAPTER"></a>TWELFTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Of our journey to Rome nothing remains to me but the memory of
sleeping in different beds in different towns, of trains screaming
through tunnels and slowing down in glass-roofed railway stations,
of endless crowds of people moving here and there in a sort of
maze, nothing but this, and the sense of being very little and very
helpless and of having to be careful not to lose sight of Father
Dan, for fear of being lost&mdash;until the afternoon of the fourth
day after we left home.</p>
<p>We were then crossing a wide rolling plain that was almost
destitute of trees, and looked, from the moving train, like green
billows of the sea with grass growing over them. Father Dan was
reading his breviary for the following day, not knowing what he
would have to do in it, when the sun set in a great blaze of red
beyond the horizon, and then suddenly a big round black ball, like
a captive balloon, seemed to rise in the midst of the glory.</p>
<p>I called Father Dan's attention to this, and in a moment he was
fearfully excited.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, my child," he cried, while tears of joy sprang to
his eyes. "Do you know what that is? That's the dome of St.
Peter's! Rome, my child, Rome!"</p>
<p>It was nine o'clock when we arrived at our destination, and in
the midst of a great confusion I walked by Father Dan's side and
held on to his vertical pocket, while he carried his own bag, and a
basket of mine, down the crowded platform to an open cab outside
the station.</p>
<p>Then Father Dan wiped his forehead with his print handkerchief
and I sat close up to him, and the driver cracked his long whip and
shouted at the pedestrians while we rattled on and on over stony
streets, which seemed to be full of statues and fountains that were
lit up by a great white light that was not moonlight and yet looked
like it.</p>
<p>But at last we stopped at a little door of a big house which
seemed to stand, with a church beside it, on a high shelf
overlooking the city, for I could see many domes like that of St.
Peter lying below us.</p>
<p>A grill in the little door was first opened and then a lady in a
black habit, with a black band round her forehead and white bands
down each side of her face, opened the door itself, and asked us to
step in, and when we had done so, she took us down a long passage
into a warm room, where another lady, dressed in the same way, only
a little grander, sat in a big red arm-chair.</p>
<p>Father Dan, who was still wearing his knitted muffler, bowed
very low to this lady, calling her the Reverend Mother Magdalene,
and she answered him in English but with a funny sound which I
afterwards knew to be a foreign accent.</p>
<p>I remember that I thought she was very beautiful, nearly as
beautiful as my mother, and when Father Dan told me to kiss her
hand I did so, and then she put me to sit in a chair and looked at
me.</p>
<p>"What is her age?" she asked, whereupon Father Dan said he
thought I would be eight that month, which was right, being
October.</p>
<p>"Small, isn't she?" said the lady, and then Father Dan said
something about poor mamma which I cannot remember.</p>
<p>After that they talked about other things, and I looked at the
pictures on the walls&mdash;pictures of Saints and Popes and, above
all, a picture of Jesus with His heart open in His bosom.</p>
<p>"The child will be hungry," said the lady. "She must have
something to eat before she goes to bed&mdash;the other children
have gone already."</p>
<p>Then she rang a hand-bell, and when the first lady came back she
said:</p>
<p>"Ask Sister Angela to come to me immediately."</p>
<p>A few minutes later Sister Angela came into the room, and she
was quite young, almost a girl, with such a sweet sad face that I
loved her instantly.</p>
<p>"This is little Mary O'Neill. Take her to the Refectory and give
her whatever she wants, and don't leave her until she is quiet and
comfortable."</p>
<p>"Very well, Mother," said Sister Angela, and taking my hand she
whispered: "Come, Mary, you look tired."</p>
<p>I rose to go with her, but at the same moment Father Dan rose
too, and I heard him say he must lose no time in finding an hotel,
for his Bishop had given him only one day to remain in Rome, and he
had to catch an early train home the following morning.</p>
<p>This fell on me like a thunderbolt. I hardly know what I had led
myself to expect, but certainly the idea of being left alone in
Rome had never once occurred to me.</p>
<p>My little heart was fluttering, and dropping the Sister's hand I
stepped back and took Father Dan's and said:</p>
<p>"You are not going to leave your little Mary are you,
Father?"</p>
<p>It was harder for the dear Father than for me, for I remember
that, fearfully flurried, he stammered in a thick voice something
about the Reverend Mother taking good care of me, and how he was
sure to come back at Christmas, according to my father's faithful
promise, to take me home for the holidays.</p>
<p>After that Sister Angela led me, sniffing a little still, to the
Refectory, which was a large, echoing room, with rows of plain deal
tables and forms, ranged in front of a reading desk that had
another and much larger picture of the Sacred Heart on the wall
above it. Only one gasjet was burning, and I sat under it to eat my
supper, and after I had taken a basin of soup I felt more
comforted.</p>
<p>Then Sister Angela lit a lamp and taking my hand she led me up a
stone staircase to the Dormitory, which was a similar room, but not
so silent, because it was full of beds, and the breathing of the
girls, who were all asleep, made it sound like the watchmaker's
shop in our village, only more church-like and solemn.</p>
<p>My bed was near to the door, and after Sister Angela had helped
me to undress, and tucked me in, she made her voice very low, and
said I would be quite comfortable now, and she was sure I was going
to be a good little girl and a dear child of the Infant Jesus; and
then I could not help taking my arms out again and clasping her
round the neck and drawing her head down and kissing her.</p>
<p>After that she took the lamp and went away to a cubicle which
was partitioned off the end of the Dormitory and there I could see
her prepare to go to bed herself&mdash;taking the white bands off
her cheeks and the black band off her forehead, and letting her
long light hair fall in beautiful wavy masses about her face, which
made her look so sweet and home like.</p>
<p>But oh, I was so lonely! Never in my life since&mdash;no, not
even when I was in my lowest depths&mdash;have I felt so little and
helpless and alone. After the Sister had gone to bed and everything
was quiet in the Dormitory save for the breathing of the
girls&mdash;all strangers to me and I to them&mdash;from mere
loneliness I covered up my head in the clothes just as I used to do
when I was a little thing and my father came into my mother's
room.</p>
<p>I try not to think bitterly of my father, but even yet I am at a
loss to know how he could have cast me away so lightly. Was it
merely that he wanted peace for his business and saw no chance of
securing it in his own home except by removing the chief cause of
Aunt Bridget's jealousy? Or was it that his old grudge against Fate
for making me a girl made him wish to rid himself of the sight of
me?</p>
<p>I do not know. I cannot say. But in either case I try in vain to
see how he could have thought he had a right, caring nothing for
me, to tear me from the mother who loved me and had paid for me so
dear; or how he could have believed that because he was my father,
charged with the care of my poor little body, he had control over
the little bleeding heart which was not his to make to suffer.</p>
<p>He is my father&mdash;God help me to think the best of him.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THIRTEENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"THIRTEENTH_CHAPTER"></a>THIRTEENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>At half past six in the morning I was awakened by the loud
ringing of the getting-up bell, and as soon as I could rouse myself
from the deep sleep of childhood I saw that a middle-aged nun with
a severe face was saying a prayer, and that all the girls in the
dormitory were kneeling in their beds while they made the
responses.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, when the girls were chattering and laughing
as they dressed, making the room tingle with twittering sounds like
a tree full of linnets in the spring, a big girl came up to me and
said:</p>
<p>"I am Mildred Bankes and Sister Angela says I am to look after
you to-day."</p>
<p>She was about fifteen years of age, and had a long
plain-featured face which reminded me of one of my father's horses
that was badly used by the farm boys; but there was something sweet
in her smile that made me like her instantly.</p>
<p>She helped me to dress in my brown velvet frock, but said that
one of her first duties would be to take me to the lay sisters who
made the black habits which all the girls in the convent wore.</p>
<p>It was still so early that the darkness of the room was just
broken by pale shafts of light from the windows, but I could see
that the children of my own age were only seven or eight
altogether, while the majority of the girls were several years
older, and Mildred explained this by telling me that the children
of the Infant Jesus, like myself, were so few that they had been
put into the dormitory of the children of the Sacred Heart.</p>
<p>In a quarter of an hour everybody was washed and dressed, and
then, at a word from Sister Angela, the girls went leaping and
laughing downstairs to the Meeting Room, which was a large hail,
with a platform at the farther end of it and another picture of the
Sacred Heart, pierced with sharp thorns, on the wall.</p>
<p>The Reverend Mother was there with the other nuns of the
Convent, all pale-faced and slow eyed women wearing rosaries, and
she said a long prayer, to which the scholars (there were seventy
or eighty altogether) made responses, and then there was silence
for five minutes, which were supposed to be devoted to meditation,
although I could not help seeing that some of the big girls were
whispering to each other while their heads were down.</p>
<p>After that, and Mass in the Church, we went scurrying away to
the Refectory, which was now warm with the steam from our breakfast
and bubbling with cheerful voices, making a noise that was like
water boiling in a saucepan.</p>
<p>I was so absorbed by all I saw that I forgot to eat until
Mildred nudged me to do so, and even when my spoon was half way to
my mouth something happened which brought it down again.</p>
<p>At the tinkle of a hand-bell one of the big girls had stepped up
to the reading-desk and begun to read from a book which I
afterwards knew to be "The Imitation of Christ." She was about
sixteen years of age, and her face was so vivid that I could not
take my eyes off it.</p>
<p>Her complexion was fair and her hair was auburn, but her eyes
were so dark and searching that when she raised her head, as she
often did, they seemed to look through and through you.</p>
<p>"Who is she?" I whispered.</p>
<p>"Alma Lier," Mildred whispered back, and when breakfast was
over, and we were trooping off to lessons, she told me something
about her.</p>
<p>Alma was an American. Her father was very rich and his home was
in New York. But her mother lived in Paris, though she was staying
at an hotel in Rome at present, and sometimes she came in a
carriage to take her daughter for a drive.</p>
<p>Alma was the cleverest girl in the school too, and sometimes at
the end of terms, when parents and friends came to the Convent and
one of the Cardinals distributed the prizes, she had so many books
to take away that she could hardly carry them down from the
platform.</p>
<p>I listened to this with admiring awe, thinking Alma the most
wonderful and worshipful of all creatures, and when I remember it
now, after all these years, and the bitter experiences which have
come with them, I hardly know whether to laugh or cry at the
thought that such was the impression she first made on me.</p>
<p>My class was with the youngest of the children, and Sister
Angela was my teacher. She was so sweet to me that her
encouragement was like a kiss and her reproof like a caress; but I
could think of nothing but Alma, and at noon, when the bell rang
for lunch and Mildred took me back to the Refectory, I wondered if
the same girl would read again.</p>
<p>She did, but this time in a foreign language, French as Mildred
whispered&mdash;from the letters of the Blessed Margaret Mary
Alacoque&mdash;and my admiration for Alma went up tenfold. I
wondered if it could possibly occur that I should ever come to know
her.</p>
<p>There is no worship like that of a child, and life for me, which
had seemed so cold and dark the day before, became warm and bright
with a new splendour.</p>
<p>I was impatient of everything that took me away from the
opportunity of meeting with Alma&mdash;the visit to the lay-sisters
to be measured for my new black clothes, the three o'clock
"rosary," when the nuns walked with their classes in the sunshine
and, above all, the voluntary visit to the Blessed Sacrament in the
Church of the Convent, which seemed to me large and gorgeous,
though divided across the middle by an open bronze screen, called a
Cancello&mdash;the inner half, as Mildred whispered, being for the
inmates of the school, while the outer half was for the
congregation which came on Sunday to Benediction.</p>
<p>But at four o'clock we had dinner, when Alma read
again&mdash;this time in Italian&mdash;from the writings of Saint
Francis of Sales&mdash;and then, to my infinite delight, came a
long recreation, when all the girls scampered out into the Convent
garden, which was still bright with afternoon sunshine and as merry
with laughter and shouts as the seashore on a windy summer
morning.</p>
<p>The garden was a large bare enclosure, bounded on two sides by
the convent buildings and on the other two by a yellow wall and an
avenue made by a line of stone pines with heads like open
umbrellas, but it had no other foliage except an old tree which
reminded me of Tommy the Mate, having gnarled and sprawling limbs,
and standing like a weather-beaten old sailor, four-square in the
middle.</p>
<p>A number of the girls were singing and dancing around this tree,
and I felt so happy just then that I should have loved to join
them, but I was consumed by a desire to come to close quarters with
the object of my devotion, so I looked eagerly about me and asked
Mildred if Alma was likely to be there.</p>
<p>"Sure to be," said Mildred, and hardly were the words out of her
mouth when Alma herself came straight down in our direction,
surrounded by a group of admiring girls, who were hanging on to her
and laughing at everything she said.</p>
<p>My heart began to thump, and without knowing what I was doing I
stopped dead short, while Mildred went on a pace or two ahead of
me.</p>
<p>Then I noticed that Alma had stopped too, and that her great
searching eyes were looking down at me. In my nervousness, I tried
to smile, but Alma continued to stare, and at length, in the tone
of one who had accidentally turned up something with her toe that
was little and ridiculous, she said:</p>
<p>"Goodness, girls, what's this?"</p>
<p>Then she burst into a fit of laughter, in which the other girls
joined, and looking me up and down they all laughed together.</p>
<p>I knew what they were laughing at&mdash;the clothes my mother
had made for me and I had felt so proud of. That burnt me like
iron, and I think my lip must have dropped, but Alma showed no
mercy.</p>
<p>"Dare say the little doll thinks herself pretty, though," she
said. And then she passed on, and the girls with her, and as they
went off they looked back over their shoulders and laughed
again.</p>
<p>Never since has any human creature&mdash;not even Alma
herself&mdash;made me suffer more than I suffered at that moment.
My throat felt tight, tears leapt to my eyes, disappointment,
humiliation, and shame swept over me like a flood, and I stood
squeezing my little handkerchief in my hand and feeling as if I
could have died.</p>
<p>At the next moment Mildred stepped back to me, and putting her
arm about my waist she said:</p>
<p>"Never mind, Mary. She's a heartless thing. Don't have anything
to do with her."</p>
<p>But all the sunshine had gone out of the day for me now and I
cried for hours. I was still crying, silently but bitterly, when,
at eight o'clock, we were saying the night prayers, and I saw Alma,
who was in the opposite benches, whispering to one of the girls who
sat next to her and then looking straight across at me.</p>
<p>And at nine o'clock when we went to bed I was crying more than
ever, so that after the good-night-bell had been rung and the
lights had been put down, Sister Angela, not knowing the cause of
my sorrow, stepped up to my bed before going down stairs for her
own studies, and whispered:</p>
<p>"You mustn't fret for home, Mary. You will soon get used to
it."</p>
<p>But hardly had I been left alone, with the dull pain I could
find no ease for, when somebody touched me on the shoulder, and,
looking up, I saw a girl in her nightdress standing beside me. It
was Alma and she said:</p>
<p>"Say, little girl, is your name O'Neill?"</p>
<p>Trembling with nervousness I answered that it was.</p>
<p>"Do you belong to the O'Neills of Ellan?"</p>
<p>Still trembling I told her that I did.</p>
<p>"My!" she said in quite another tone, and then I saw that by
some means I had begun to look different in her eyes.</p>
<p>After a moment she sat on the side of my bed and asked questions
about my home&mdash;if it was not large and very old, with big
stone staircases, and great open fireplaces, and broad terraces,
and beautiful walks going down to the sea.</p>
<p>I was so filled with the joy of finding myself looking grand in
Alma's eyes that I answered "yes" and "yes" without thinking too
closely about her questions, and my tears were all brushed away
when she said:</p>
<p>"I knew somebody who lived in your house once, and I'll tell her
all about you."</p>
<p>She stayed a few moments longer, and when going off she
whispered:</p>
<p>"Hope you don't feel badly about my laughing in the garden
to-day. I didn't mean a thing. But if any of the girls laugh again
just say you're Alma Lier's friend and she's going to take care of
you."</p>
<p>I could hardly believe my ears. Some great new splendour had
suddenly dawned upon me and I was very happy.</p>
<p>I did not know then that the house which Alma had been talking
of was not my father's house, but Castle Raa. I did not know then
that the person who had lived there was her mother, and that in her
comely and reckless youth she had been something to the bad Lord
Raa who had lashed my father and sworn at my grandmother.</p>
<p>I did not know anything that was dead and buried in the past, or
shrouded and veiled in the future. I only knew that Alma had called
herself my friend and promised to take care of me. So with a glad
heart I went to sleep.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FOURTEENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"FOURTEENTH_CHAPTER"></a>FOURTEENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Alma kept her word, though perhaps her method of protection was
such as would have commended itself only to the heart of a
child.</p>
<p>It consisted in calling me Margaret Mary after our patron saint
of the Sacred Heart, in taking me round the garden during
recreation as if I had been a pet poodle, and, above all, in making
my bed the scene of the conversaziones which some of the girls held
at night when they were supposed to be asleep.</p>
<p>The secrecy of these gatherings flattered me, and when the
unclouded moon, in the depths of the deep blue Italian sky, looked
in on my group of girls in their nightdresses, bunched together on
my bed, with my own little body between, I had a feeling of dignity
as well as solemnity and awe.</p>
<p>Of course Alma was the chief spokeswoman at these whispered
conferences. Sometimes she told us of her drives into the Borghese
Gardens, where she saw the King and Queen, or to the Hunt on the
Campagna, where she met the flower of the aristocracy, or to the
Pincio, where the Municipal band played in the pavilion, while
ladies sat in their carriages in the sunshine, and officers in blue
cloaks saluted them and smiled.</p>
<p>Sometimes she indicated her intentions for the future, which was
certainly not to be devoted to retreats and novenas, or to witness
another black dress as long as she lived, and if she married (which
was uncertain) it was not to be to an American, but to a Frenchman,
because Frenchmen had "family" and "blood," or perhaps to an
Englishman, if he was a member of the House of Lords, in which case
she would attend all the race-meetings and Coronations, and take
tea at the Carlton, where she would eat <i>m&eacute;ringues
glac&eacute;s</i> every day and have as many <i>&eacute;clairs</i>
as she liked.</p>
<p>And sometimes she would tell us the stories of the novels which
she bribed one of the washing-women to smuggle into the
convent&mdash;stories of ladies and their lovers, and of
intoxicating dreams of kissing and fondling, at which the bigger
girls, with far-off suggestions of sexual mysteries still
unexplored, would laugh and shudder, and then Alma would say:</p>
<p>"But hush, girls! Margaret Mary will be shocked."</p>
<p>Occasionally these conferences would be interrupted by Mildred's
voice from the other end of the dormitory, where she would raise
her head from her pillow and say:</p>
<p>"Alma Lier, you ought to be ashamed of yourself&mdash;keeping
that child up when she ought to be asleep, instead of listening to
your wicked stories."</p>
<p>"Helloa, Mother Mildred, is that you?" Alma would answer, and
then the girls would laugh, and Mildred was supposed to be covered
with confusion.</p>
<p>One night Sister Angela's footsteps were heard on the stairs,
and then the girls flew back to their beds, where, with the furtive
instinct of their age and sex, they pretended to be sleeping
soundly when the Sister entered the room. But the Sister was not
deceived, and walking up the aisle between the beds she said in an
angry tone:</p>
<p>"Alma Lier, if this ever occurs again I'll step down to the
Reverend Mother and tell her all about you."</p>
<p>Little as I was, I saw that between Alma and Sister Angela there
was a secret feud, which must soon break into open rupture, but for
my own part I was entirely happy, being still proud of Alma's
protection and only feeling any misgivings when Mildred's
melancholy eyes were looking at me.</p>
<p>Thus week followed week until we were close upon Christmas, and
the girls, who were to be permitted to go home before the Feast,
began to count the days to the holidays. I counted them too, and
when anybody talked of her brother I thought of Martin Conrad,
though his faithful little figure was fading away from me, and when
anybody spoke of her parents I remembered my mother, for whom my
affection never failed.</p>
<p>But, within a week from the time for breaking up, the Reverend
Mother sent for me, and with a sinking heart I went to her room,
knowing well what she was going to say.</p>
<p>"You are not to go home for the holidays this time, my child.
You are to remain here, and Sister Angela is to stay to take care
of you."</p>
<p>She had a letter from Father Dan, telling her that my mother was
still unwell, and for this and other reasons it was considered best
that I should not return at Christmas.</p>
<p>Father Dan had written a letter to me also, beginning, "My dear
daughter in Jesus" and ending "Yours in Xt," saying it was not his
fault that he could not fulfil his promise, but my father was much
from home now-a-days and Aunt Bridget was more difficult than ever,
so perhaps I should be happier at the Convent.</p>
<p>It was a bitter blow, though the bitterest part of it lay in the
fear that the girls would think I was of so little importance to my
people that they did not care to see me.</p>
<p>But the girls were too eager about their own concerns to care
much about me, and even on the very last day and at the very last
moment, when everything was bustle and joy, and boxes were being
carried downstairs, and everybody was kissing everybody else and
wishing each other a Happy Christmas, and then flying away like mad
things, and I alone was being left, Alma herself, before she
stepped into a carriage in which a stout lady wearing furs was
waiting to receive her, only said:</p>
<p>"By-by, Margaret Mary! Take care of Sister Angela."</p>
<p>Next day the Reverend Mother went off to her cottage at Nemi,
and the other nuns and novices to their friends in the country, and
then Sister Angela and I were alone in the big empty, echoing
convent&mdash;save for two elderly lay Sisters, who cooked and
cleaned for us, and the Chaplain, who lived by himself in a little
white hut like a cell which stood at the farthest corner of the
garden.</p>
<p>We moved our quarters to a room in the front of the house, so as
to look out over the city, and down into the piazza which was full
of traffic, and after a while we had many cheerful hours
together.</p>
<p>During the days before Christmas we spent our mornings in
visiting the churches and basilicas where there were little
illuminated models of the Nativity, with the Virgin and the Infant
Jesus in the stable among the straw. The afternoons we spent at
home in the garden, where the Chaplain, in his black soutane and
biretta, was always sitting under the old tree, reading his
breviary.</p>
<p>His name was Father Giovanni and he was a tall young man with a
long, thin, pale face, and when Sister Angela first took me up to
him she said:</p>
<p>"This is our Margaret Mary."</p>
<p>Then his sad face broke into warm sunshine, and he stroked my
head, and sent me away to skip with my skipping-rope, while he and
Sister Angela sat together under the tree, and afterwards walked to
and fro in the avenue between the stone pines and the wall, until
they came to his cell in the corner, where she craned her neck at
the open door as if she would have liked to go in and make things
more tidy and comfortable.</p>
<p>On Christmas Day we had currant cake in honour of the feast, and
Sister Angela asked Father Giovanni to come to tea, and he came,
and was quite cheerful, so that when the Sister, who was also very
happy, signalled to me to take some mistletoe from the bottom of a
picture I held it over his head and kissed him from behind. Then he
snatched me up in his arms and kissed me back, and we had a great
romp round the chairs and tables.</p>
<p>But the Ave Maria began to ring from the churches, and Father
Giovanni (according to the rule of our Convent) having to go, he
kissed me again, and then I said:</p>
<p>"Why don't you kiss Sister Angela too?"</p>
<p>At that they only looked at each other and laughed, but after a
moment he kissed her hand, and then she went downstairs to see him
out into the garden.</p>
<p>When she came back her eyes were sparkling and her cheeks were
flushed, and, that night, when she took away her black and white
whimple and gorget on going to bed, she stood before a
looking-glass and wound her beautiful light hair round her finger
and curled it over her forehead in the way it was worn by the
ladies we saw in the streets.</p>
<p>I think it was two nights later that she told me I was to go to
bed early because Father Giovanni was not well and she would have
to go over to see him.</p>
<p>She went, and I got into bed, but I could not sleep, and while I
lay waiting for Sister Angela I listened to some men who as they
crossed the piazza were singing, in tremulous voices, to their
mandolines and guitars, what I believed to be love songs, for I had
begun to learn Italian.</p>
<p>"<i>Oh bella Napoli. Oh suol beato<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Onde soiridere volta il
creato."</span><br /></i></p>
<p>It was late when Sister Angela came back and then she was
breathing hard as if she had been running. I asked if Father
Giovanni's sickness was worse, and she said no, it was better, and
I was to say nothing about it. But she could not rest and at last
she said:</p>
<p>"Didn't we forget to say our prayers, Mary?"</p>
<p>So I got up again and Sister Angela said one of the beautiful
prayers out of our prayer-book. But her voice was very low and when
she came to the words:</p>
<p>"O Father of all mankind, forgive all sinners who repent of
their sins," she broke down altogether.</p>
<p>I thought she was ill, but she said it was only a cold she had
caught in crossing the garden and I was to go to sleep like a good
girl and think no more about her.</p>
<p>But in the middle of the night I awoke, and Sister Angela was
crying.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FIFTEENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"FIFTEENTH_CHAPTER"></a>FIFTEENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Most of the girls were depressed when they returned to school,
but Alma was in high spirits, and on the first night of the term
she crept over to my bed and asked what we had been doing during
the holidays.</p>
<p>"Not a thing, eh?"</p>
<p>I answered that we had done lots of things and been very
happy.</p>
<p>"Happy? In this gloomy old convent? You and Sister Angela
alone?"</p>
<p>I told her we had two lay sisters-and then there was Father
Giovanni.</p>
<p>"Father Giovanni? That serious old cross-bones?"</p>
<p>I said he was not always serious, and that on Christmas Day he
had come to tea and kissed me under the mistletoe.</p>
<p>"Kissed you under the mistletoe!" said Alma, and then she
whispered eagerly,</p>
<p>"He didn't kiss Sister Angela, did he?"</p>
<p>I suppose I was flattered by her interest, and this loosened my
tongue, for I answered:</p>
<p>"He kissed her hand, though."</p>
<p>"Kissed her hand? My! . . . Of course she was very angry . . .
wasn't she angry?"</p>
<p>I answered no, and in my simplicity I proceeded to prove this by
explaining that Sister Angela had taken Father Giovanni down to the
door, and when he was ill she had nursed him.</p>
<p>"Nursed him? In his own house, you mean?"</p>
<p>"Yes, at night, too, and she stayed until he was better, and
caught a cold coming back."</p>
<p>"Well, I never!" said Alma, and I remember that I was very
pleased with myself during this interview, for by the moonlight
which was then shining into the room, I could see that Alma's eyes
were sparkling.</p>
<p>The next night we recommenced our conferences in bed, when Alma
told us all about her holiday, which she had spent "way up in St.
Moritz," among deep snow and thick ice, skating, bobbing, lugging,
and above all riding astride, and dragging a man on skis behind
her.</p>
<p>"Such lots of fun," she said. And the best of it was at night
when there were dances and fancy-dress balls with company which
included all the smart people in Europe, and men who gave a girl
such a good time if she happened to be pretty and was likely to
have a dot.</p>
<p>Alma had talked so eagerly and the girls had listened so
intently, that nobody was aware that Sister Angela had returned to
the room until she stepped forward and said:</p>
<p>"Alma Lier, I'm ashamed of you. Go back to your bed, miss, this
very minute."</p>
<p>The other girls crept away and I half covered my face with my
bed-clothes, but Alma stood up to Sister Angela and answered her
back.</p>
<p>"Go to bed yourself, and don't speak to me like that, or you'll
pay for your presumption."</p>
<p>"Pay? Presumption? You insolent thing, you are corrupting the
whole school and are an utter disgrace to it. I warned you that I
would tell the Reverend Mother what you are and now I've a great
mind to do it."</p>
<p>"Do it. I dare you to do it. Do it to-night, and to-morrow
morning <i>I</i> will do something."</p>
<p>"What will you do, you brazen hussy?" said Sister Angela, but I
could see that her lip was trembling.</p>
<p>"Never mind what. If I'm a hussy I'm not a hypocrite, and as for
corrupting the school, and being a disgrace to it, I'll leave the
Reverend Mother to say who is doing that."</p>
<p>Low as the light was I could see that Sister Angela was deadly
pale. There was a moment of silence in which I thought she glanced
in my direction, and then stammering something which I did not
hear, she left the dormitory.</p>
<p>It was long before she returned and when she did so I saw her
creep into her cubicle and sit there for quite a great time before
going to bed. My heart was thumping hard, for I had a vague feeling
that I had been partly to blame for what had occurred, but after a
while I fell asleep and remembered no more until I was awakened in
the middle of the night by somebody kissing me in my sleep.</p>
<p>It was Sister Angela, and she was turning away, but I called her
back, and she knelt by my bed and whispered:</p>
<p>"Hush! I know what has happened, but I don't blame you for
it."</p>
<p>I noticed that she was wearing her out-door cloak, and that she
was breathing rapidly, just as she did on the night she came from
the chaplain's quarters, and when I asked if she was going anywhere
she said yes, and if I ever heard anything against Sister Angela I
was to think the best of her.</p>
<p>"But you are so good. . . ."</p>
<p>"No, I am not good. I am very wicked. I should never have
thought of being a nun, but I'm glad now that I'm only a novice and
have never taken the vows."</p>
<p>After that she told me to go to sleep, and then she kissed me
again, and I thought she was going to cry, but she rose hurriedly
and left the room.</p>
<p>Next morning after the getting-up bell had been rung, and I had
roused myself to full consciousness, I found that four or five nuns
were standing together near the door of the dormitory talking about
something that had happened during the night&mdash;Sister Angela
had gone!</p>
<p>Half an hour afterwards when full of this exciting event, the
girls went bursting down to the Meeting Room they found the nuns in
great agitation over an incident of still deeper
gravity&mdash;Father Giovanni also had disappeared!</p>
<p>A convent school is like a shell on the shore of a creek, always
rumbling with the rumour of the little sea it lives under; and by
noon the girls, who had been palpitating with curiosity, thought
they knew everything that had happened&mdash;how at four in the
morning Father Giovanni and Sister Angela had been seen to come out
of the little door which connected the garden with the street; how
at seven they had entered a clothing emporium in the Corso, where
going in at one door as priest and nun they had come out at another
as ordinary civilians; how at eight they had taken the first train
to Civita Vecchia, arriving in time to catch a steamer sailing at
ten, and how they were now on their way to England.</p>
<p>By some mysterious instinct of their sex the girls had gathered
with glistening eyes in front of the chaplain's deserted quarters,
where Alma leaned against the wall with her insteps crossed and
while the others talked she smiled, as much as to say, "I told you
so."</p>
<p>As for me I was utterly wretched, and being now quite certain
that I was the sole cause of Sister Angela's misfortune, I was
sitting under the tree in the middle of the garden, when Alma,
surrounded by her usual group of girls, came down on me.</p>
<p>"What's this?" she said. "Margaret Mary crying? Feeling badly
for Sister Angela, is she? Why, you little silly, you needn't cry
for her. She's having the time of her life, she is!"</p>
<p>At this the girls laughed and shuddered, as they used to do when
Alma told them stories, but just at that moment the nun with the
stern face (she was the Mother of the Novices) came up and said,
solemnly:</p>
<p>"Alma Lier, the Reverend Mother wishes to speak to you."</p>
<p>"To me?" said Alma, in a tone of surprise, but at the next
moment she went off jauntily.</p>
<p>Hours passed and Alma did not return, and nothing occurred until
afternoon "rosary," when the Mother of the Novices came again and
taking me by the hand said:</p>
<p>"Come with me, my child."</p>
<p>I knew quite well where we were going to, and my lip was
trembling when we entered the Reverend Mother's room, for Alma was
there, sitting by the stove, and close beside her, with an angry
look, was the stout lady in furs whom I had seen in the carriage at
the beginning of the holidays.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid," said the Reverend Mother, and drawing me to
her side she asked me to tell her what I had told Alma about Sister
Angela.</p>
<p>I repeated our conversation as nearly as I could remember it,
and more than once Alma nodded her head as if in assent, but the
Reverend Mother's face grew darker at every word and, seeing this,
I said:</p>
<p>"But if Sister Angela did anything wrong I'm sure she was very
sorry, for when she came back she said her prayers, and when she
got to 'Father of all mankind, forgive all sinners . . .'"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, that will do," said the Reverend Mother, and then she
handed me back to the Mother of the Novices, telling her to warn me
to say nothing to the other children.</p>
<p>Alma did not return to us at dinner, or at recreation, or at
chapel (when another chaplain said vespers), or even at nine
o'clock, when we went to bed. But next morning, almost as soon as
the Mother of the Novices had left the dormitory, she burst into
the room saying:</p>
<p>"I'm leaving this silly old convent, girls. Mother has brought
the carriage, and I've only come to gather up my belongings."</p>
<p>Nobody spoke, and while she wrapped up her brushes and combs in
her nightdress, she joked about Sister Angela and Father Giovanni
and then about Mildred Bankes, whom she called "Reverend Mother
Mildred," saying it would be her turn next.</p>
<p>Then she tipped up her mattress, and taking a novel from under
it she threw the book on to my bed, saying:</p>
<p>"Margaret Mary will have to be your story-teller now. By-by,
girls!"</p>
<p>Nobody laughed. For the first time Alma's humour had failed her,
and when we went downstairs to the Meeting Room it was with sedate
and quiet steps.</p>
<p>The nuns were all there, with their rosaries and crosses,
looking as calm as if nothing had occurred, but the girls were
thinking of Alma, and when, after prayers, during the five minutes
of silence for meditation, we heard the wheels of a carriage going
off outside, we knew what had happened&mdash;Alma had gone.</p>
<p>We were rising to go to Mass when the Reverend Mother said,</p>
<p>"Children, I have a word to say to you. You all know that one of
our novices has left us. You also know that one of our scholars has
just gone. It is my wish that you should forget both of them, and I
shall look upon it as an act of disobedience if any girl in the
Convent ever mentions their names again."</p>
<p>All that day I was in deep distress, and when, night coming, I
took my troubles to bed, telling myself I had now lost Alma also,
and it was all my fault, somebody put her arms about me in the
darkness and whispered:</p>
<p>"Mary O'Neill, are you awake?"</p>
<p>It was Mildred, and I suppose my snuffling answered her, for she
said:</p>
<p>"You mustn't cry for Alma Lier. She was no friend of yours, and
it was the best thing that ever happened to you when she was turned
out of the convent."</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SIXTEENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"SIXTEENTH_CHAPTER"></a>SIXTEENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>A child lives from hour to hour, and almost at the same moment
that my heart was made desolate by the loss of my two friends it
was quickened to a new interest.</p>
<p>Immediately after the departure of Sister Angela and Alma we
were all gathered in the Meeting Room for our weekly rehearsal of
the music of the Benediction&mdash;the girls, the novices, the
nuns, the Reverend Mother, and a Maestro from the Pope's choir, a
short fat man, who wore a black soutane and a short lace
tippet.</p>
<p>Benediction was the only service of our church which I knew,
being the one my mother loved best and could do most of for herself
in the solitude of her invalid room, but the form used in the
Convent differed from that to which I had been accustomed, and even
the <i>Tantum ergo</i> and the <i>O Salutaris Hostia</i> I could
not sing.</p>
<p>On this occasion a litany was added which I had heard before,
and then came a hymn of the Blessed Virgin which I remembered well.
My mother sang it herself and taught me to sing it, so that when
the Maestro, swinging his little ivory baton, began in his alto
voice&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Ave maris stella,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dei Mater
alma&mdash;"</span><br /></i></p>
<p>I joined in with the rest, but sang in English instead of Latin
Of all appeals to the memory that of music is the strongest, and
after a moment I forgot that I was at school in Rome, being back in
my mother's room in Ellan, standing by her piano and singing while
she played. I think I must have let my little voice go, just as I
used to do at home, when it rang up to the wooden rafters, for
utterly lost to my surroundings I had got as far as&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Virgin of all virgins,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To thy shelter take
us&mdash;"</span><br /></i></p>
<p>when suddenly I became aware that I alone was singing, the
children about me being silent, and even the Maestro's baton
slowing down. Then I saw that all eyes were turned in my direction,
and overwhelmed with confusion I stopped, for my voice broke and
slittered into silence.</p>
<p>"Go on, little angel," said the Maestro, but I was trembling all
over by this time and could not utter a sound.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the Reverend Mother said: "Let Mary O'Neill sing
the hymn in church in future."</p>
<p>As soon as I had conquered my nervousness at singing in the
presence of the girls, I did so, singing the first line of each
verse alone, and I remember to have heard that the congregations on
Sunday afternoons grew larger and larger, until, within a few
weeks, the church was densely crowded.</p>
<p>Perhaps my childish heart was stirred by vanity in all this, for
I remember that ladies in beautiful dresses would crowd to the
bronze screen that separated us from the public and whisper among
themselves, "Which is she?" "The little one in the green scarf with
the big eyes!" "God bless her!"</p>
<p>But surely it was a good thing that at length life had began to
have a certain joy for me, for as time went on I became absorbed in
the life of the Convent, and particularly in the services of the
church, so that home itself began to fade away, and when the
holidays came round and excuses were received for not sending for
me, the pain of my disappointment became less and less until at
last it disappeared altogether.</p>
<p>If ever a child loved her mother I did, and there were moments
when I reproached myself with not thinking of her for a whole day.
These were the moments when a letter came from Father Dan, telling
me she was less well than before and her spark of life had to be
coaxed and trimmed or it would splutter out altogether.</p>
<p>But the effect of such warnings was wiped away when my mother
wrote herself, saying I was to be happy as she was happy, because
she knew that though so long separated we should soon be together,
and the time would not seem long.</p>
<p>Not understanding the deeper meaning that lay behind words like
these, I was nothing loath to put aside the thought of home until
little by little it faded away from me in the distance, just as the
island itself had done on the day when I sailed out with Martin
Conrad on our great voyage of exploration to St. Mary's Rock.</p>
<p>Thus two years and a half passed since I arrived in Rome before
the great fact befell me which was to wipe all other facts out of
my remembrance.</p>
<p>It was Holy Week, the season of all seasons for devotion to the
Sacred Heart, and our Convent was palpitating with the joy of its
spiritual duties, the many offices, the masses for the repose of
the souls in Purgatory, the preparations for Tenebrae, with the
chanting of the Miserere, and for Holy Saturday and Easter Day,
with the singing of the Gloria and the return of the Alleluia.</p>
<p>But beyond all this for me were the arrangements for my first
confession, which, coming a little late, I made with ten or twelve
other girls of my sodality, feeling so faint when I took my turn
and knelt by the grating, and heard the whispering voice within,
like something from the unseen, something supernatural, something
divine, that I forgot all I had come to say and the priest had to
prompt me.</p>
<p>And beyond that again were the arrangements for my first
communion, which was to take place on Easter morning, when I was to
walk in procession with the other girls, dressed all in white,
behind a gilded figure of the Virgin, singing "Ave maris stella,"
through the piazza into the church, where one of the Cardinals, in
the presence of the fathers and mothers of the other children, was
to put the Holy Wafer on our tongues and we were to know for the
first time the joy of communion with our Lord.</p>
<p>But that was not to be for me.</p>
<p>On the morning of Holy Wednesday the blow fell. The luminous
grey of the Italian dawn was filtering through the windows of the
dormitory, like the light in a tomb, and a multitude of little
birds on the old tree in the garden were making a noise like water
falling on small stones in a fountain, when the Mother of the
Novices came to my bedside and said:</p>
<p>"You are to go to the Reverend Mother as soon as possible, my
child."</p>
<p>Her voice, usually severe, was so soft that I knew something had
happened, and when I went downstairs I also knew, before the
Reverend Mother had spoken, what she was going to say.</p>
<p>"Mary," she said, "I am Sorry to tell you that your mother is
ill."</p>
<p>I listened intently, fearing that worse would follow.</p>
<p>"She is very ill&mdash;very seriously ill, and she wishes to see
you. Therefore you are to go home immediately."</p>
<p>The tears sprang to my eyes, and the Reverend Mother drew me to
her side and laid my head on her breast and comforted me, saying my
dear mother had lived the life of a good Christian and could safely
trust in the redeeming blood of our Blessed Saviour. But I thought
she must have some knowledge of the conditions of my life at home,
for she told me that whatever happened I was to come back to
her.</p>
<p>"Tell your father you <i>wish</i> to come back to me," she said,
and then she explained the arrangements that were being made for my
journey.</p>
<p>I was to travel alone by the Paris express which left Rome at
six o'clock that evening. The Mother of the Novices was to put me
in a sleeping car and see that the greatest care would be taken of
me until I arrived at Calais, where Father Donovan was to meet the
train and take me home.</p>
<p>I cried a great deal, I remember, but everybody in the Convent
was kind, and when, of my own choice, I returned to the girls at
recreation, the sinister sense of dignity which by some strange
irony of fate comes to all children when the Angel of Death is
hovering over them, came to me also&mdash;poor, helpless
innocent&mdash;and I felt a certain distinction in my sorrow.</p>
<p>At five o'clock the omnibus of the Convent had been brought
round to the door, and I was seated in one corner of it, with the
Mother of the Novices in front of me, when Mildred Bankes came
running breathlessly downstairs to say that the Reverend Mother had
given her permission to see me off.</p>
<p>Half an hour later Mildred and I were sitting in a compartment
of the Wagon-Lit, while the Mother was talking to the conductor on
the platform.</p>
<p>Mildred, whose eyes were wet, was saying something about herself
which seems pitiful enough now in the light of what has happened
since.</p>
<p>She was to leave the Convent soon, and before I returned to it
she would be gone. She was poor and an orphan, both her parents
being dead, and if she had her own way she would become a nun. In
any case our circumstances would be so different, our ways of life
so far apart, that we might never meet again; but if . . .</p>
<p>Before she had finished a bell rang on the platform, and a
moment or two afterwards the train slid out of the station.</p>
<p>Then for the first time I began to realise the weight of the
blow that had fallen on me. I was sitting alone in my big
compartment, we were running into the Campagna, the heavens were
ablaze with the glory of the sunset, which was like fields of
glistening fire, but darkness seemed to have fallen on all the
world.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SEVENTEENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"SEVENTEENTH_CHAPTER"></a>SEVENTEENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Early on Good Friday I arrived at Calais. It was a misty, rimy,
clammy morning, and a thick fog was lying over the Channel.</p>
<p>Almost before the train stopped I saw Father Dan, with his coat
collar turned up, waiting for me on the platform. I could see that
he was greatly moved at the sight of me, but was trying hard to
maintain his composure.</p>
<p>"Now don't worry, my child, don't worry," he said. "It will be
all ri. . . . But how well you are looking! And how you have grown!
And how glad your poor mother will be to see you!"</p>
<p>I tried to ask how she was. "Is she . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes, thank God, she's alive, and while there's life there's
hope."</p>
<p>We travelled straight through without stopping and arrived at
Blackwater at seven the same evening. There we took train, for
railways were running in Ellan now, and down the sweet valleys that
used to be green with grass, and through the little crofts that
used to be red with fuchsia, there was a long raw welt of upturned
earth.</p>
<p>At the station of our village my father's carriage was waiting
for us and a strange footman shrugged his shoulders in answer to
some whispered question of Father Dan's, and from that I gathered
that my mother's condition was unchanged.</p>
<p>We reached home at dusk, just as somebody was lighting a line of
new electric lamps that had been set up in the drive to show the
way for the carriage under the chestnuts in which the rooks used to
build and caw.</p>
<p>I knew the turn of the path from which the house could be first
seen, and I looked for it, remembering the last glimpse I had of my
mother at her window. Father Dan looked, too, but for another
reason&mdash;to see if the blinds were down.</p>
<p>Aunt Bridget was in the hall, and when Father Dan, who had grown
more and more excited as we approached the end of our journey,
asked how my mother was now, poor thing, she answered:</p>
<p>"Worse; distinctly worse; past recognising anybody; so all this
trouble and expense has been wasted."</p>
<p>As she had barely recognised me I ran upstairs with a timid and
quiet step and without waiting to take off my outer clothes made my
way to my mother's bedroom.</p>
<p>I remember the heavy atmosphere of the room as I opened the
door. I remember the sense I had of its being lower and smaller
than I thought. I remember the black four-foot bedstead with the
rosary hanging on a brass nail at the pillow end. I remember my
little cot which still stood in the same place and contained some
of the clothes I had worn as a child, and even some of the toys I
had played with.</p>
<p>A strange woman, in the costume of a nurse, turned to look at me
as I entered, but I did not at first see my mother, and when at
length I did see her, with her eyes closed, she looked so white and
small as to be almost hidden in the big white bed.</p>
<p>Presently Father Dan came in, followed by Doctor Conrad and Aunt
Bridget, and finally my father, who was in his shirt sleeves and
had a pen in his ear, I remember.</p>
<p>Then Father Dan, who was trembling very much, took me by the
hand and led me to my mother's side, where stooping over her, and
making his voice very low, yet speaking as one who was calling into
a long tunnel, he said:</p>
<p>"My daughter! My daughter! Here is our little Mary. She has come
home to see you."</p>
<p>Never shall I forget what followed. First, my mother's long
lashes parted and she looked at me with a dazed expression as if
still in a sort of dream. Then her big eyes began to blaze like
torches in dark hollows, and then (though they had thought her
strength was gone and her voice would never be heard again) she
raised herself in her bed, stretched out her arms to me, and cried
in loud strong tones:</p>
<p>"Mally veen! My Mally veen!"</p>
<p>How long I lay with my arms about my mother, and my mother's
arms about me I do not know. I only know that over my head I heard
Father Dan saying, as if speaking to a child:</p>
<p>"You are happy now, are you not?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I am happy now," my mother answered.</p>
<p>"You have everything you want?"</p>
<p>"Everything&mdash;everything!"</p>
<p>Then came my father's voice, saying:</p>
<p>"Well, you've got your girl, Isabel. You wanted her, so we sent
for her, and here she is."</p>
<p>"You have been very good to me, Daniel," said my mother, who was
kissing my forehead and crying in her joy.</p>
<p>When I raised my head I found Father Dan in great
excitement.</p>
<p>"Did you see that then?" he was saying to Doctor Conrad.</p>
<p>"I would have gone on my knees all the way to Blackwater to see
it."</p>
<p>"I couldn't have believed it possible," the Doctor replied.</p>
<p>"Ah, what children we are, entirely. God confounds all our
reckoning. We can't count with His miracles. And the greatest of
all miracles is a mother's love for her child."</p>
<p>"Let us leave her now, though," said the Doctor. "She's like
herself again, but still . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes, let us leave them together," whispered Father Dan, and
having swept everybody out before him (I thought Aunt Bridget went
away ashamed) he stepped off himself on tiptoe, as if treading on
holy ground.</p>
<p>Then my mother, who was holding my hand and sometimes putting it
to her lips, said:</p>
<p>"Tell me everything that has happened."</p>
<p>As soon as my little tongue was loosed I told her all about my
life at the Convent&mdash;about the Reverend Mother and the nuns
and the novices and the girls (all except Sister Angela and Alma)
and the singing of the hymn to the Virgin&mdash;talking on and on
and on, without observing that, after a while, my mother's eyes had
closed again, and that her hand had become cold and moist.</p>
<p>At length she said: "Is it getting dark, Mary?"</p>
<p>I told her it was night and the lamp was burning.</p>
<p>"Is it going out then?" she asked, and when I answered that it
was not she did not seem to hear, so I stopped talking, and for
some time there was silence in which I heard nothing but the
ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece, the barking of a sheep dog
a long way off, and the husky breathing in my mother's throat.</p>
<p>I was beginning to be afraid when the nurse returned. She was
going to speak quite cheerfully, but after a glance at my mother
she went out quickly and came back in a moment with Doctor Conrad
and Father Dan.</p>
<p>I heard the doctor say something about a change, whereupon
Father Dan hurried away, and in a moment there was much confusion.
The nurse spoke of taking me to another room but the doctor
said:</p>
<p>"No, our little woman will be brave," and then leading me aside
he whispered that God was sending for my mother and I must be quiet
and not cry.</p>
<p>Partly undressing I climbed into my cot and lay still for the
next half hour, while the doctor held his hand on my mother's pulse
and the nurse spread a linen cloth over a table and put four or
five lighted candles on it.</p>
<p>I remember that I was thinking that if "God sending for my
mother" meant that she was to be put into a box and buried under
the ground it was terrible and cruel, and perhaps if I prayed to
our Lady He would not find it in His heart to do so. I was trying
to do this, beginning under my breath, "O Holy Virgin, thou art so
lovely, thou art so gracious . . ." when the nurse said:</p>
<p>"Here they are back again."</p>
<p>Then I heard footsteps outside, and going to the window I saw a
sight not unlike that which I had seen on the night of the
Waits.</p>
<p>A group of men were coming towards the house, with Father Dan in
the middle of them. Father Dan, with his coat hung over his arms
like a cloak, was carrying something white in both hands, and the
men were carrying torches to light him on his way.</p>
<p>I knew what it was&mdash;it was the Blessed Sacrament, which
they were bringing to my mother, and when Father Dan had come into
the room, saying "Peace be to this house," and laid a little white
box on the table, and thrown off his coat, he was wearing his
priest's vestments underneath.</p>
<p>Then the whole of my father's household&mdash;all except my
father himself&mdash;came into my mother's room, including Aunt
Bridget, who sat with folded arms in the darkness by the wall, and
the servants, who knelt in a group by the door.</p>
<p>Father Dan roused my mother by calling to her again, and after
she had opened her eyes he began to read. Sometimes his voice
seemed to be choked with sobs, as if the heart of the man were
suffering, and sometimes it pealed out loudly as if the soul of the
priest were inspiring him.</p>
<p>After Communion he gave my mother Extreme
Unction&mdash;anointing the sweet eyes which had seen no evil, the
dear lips which had uttered no wrong, and the feet which had walked
in the ways of God.</p>
<p>All this time there was a solemn hush in the house like that of
a church&mdash;no sound within except my father's measured tread in
the room below, and none without except the muffled murmur which
the sea makes when it is far away and going out.</p>
<p>When all was over my mother seemed more at ease, and after
asking for me and being told I was in the cot, she said:</p>
<p>"You must all go and rest. Mary and I will be quite right
now."</p>
<p>A few minutes afterwards my mother and I were alone once more,
and then she called me into her bed and clasped her arms about me
and I lay with my face hidden in her neck.</p>
<p>What happened thereafter seems to be too sacred to write of,
almost too sacred to think about, yet it is all as a memory of
yesterday, while other events of my life have floated away to the
ocean of things that are forgotten and lost.</p>
<p>"Listen, darling," she said, and then, speaking in whispers, she
told me she had heard all I had said about the Convent, and
wondered if I would not like to live there always, becoming one of
the good and holy nuns.</p>
<p>I must have made some kind of protest, for she went on to say
how hard the world was to a woman and how difficult she had found
it.</p>
<p>"Not that your father has been to blame&mdash;you must never
think that, Mary, yet still . . ."</p>
<p>But tears from her tender heart were stealing down her face and
she had to stop.</p>
<p>Even yet I had not realised all that the solemn time foreboded,
for I said something about staying with my mother; and then in her
sweet voice, she told me nervously, breaking the news to me gently,
that she was going to leave me, that she was going to heaven, but
she would think of me when she was there, and if God permitted she
would watch over me, or, if that might not be, she would ask our
Lady to do so.</p>
<p>"So you see we shall never be parted, never really. We shall
always be together. Something tells me that wherever you are, and
whatever you are doing, I shall know all about it."</p>
<p>This comforted me, and I think it comforted my mother also,
though God knows if it would have done so, if, with her dying eyes,
she could have seen what was waiting for her child.</p>
<p>It fills my heart brimful to think of what happened next.</p>
<p>She told me to say a <i>De Profundis</i> for her sometimes, and
to think of her when I sang the hymn to the Virgin. Then she kissed
me and told me to go to sleep, saying she was going to sleep too,
and if it should prove to be the eternal sleep, it would be only
like going to sleep at night and awaking in the morning, and then
we should be together again, and "the time between would not seem
long."</p>
<p>"So good-night, darling, and God bless you," she said.</p>
<p>And as well as I could I answered her "Good-night!"</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>When I awoke from the profound slumber of childhood it was noon
of the next day and the sun was shining. Doctor Conrad was lifting
me out of bed, and Father Dan, who had just thrown open the window,
was saying in a tremulous voice:</p>
<p>"Your dear mother has gone to God."</p>
<p>I began to cry, but he checked me and said:</p>
<p>"Don't call her back. She's on her way to God's beautiful
Paradise after all her suffering. Let her go!"</p>
<p>So I lost her, my mother, my saint, my angel.</p>
<p>It was Easter Eve, and the church bells were ringing the
Gloria.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="EIGHTEENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"EIGHTEENTH_CHAPTER"></a>EIGHTEENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>After my mother's death there was no place left for me in my
father's house.</p>
<p>Betsy Beauty (who was now called Miss Betsy and gave herself
more than ever the airs of the daughter of the family) occupied
half her days with the governess who had been engaged to teach her,
and the other half in driving, dressed in beautiful clothes, to the
houses of the gentry round about.</p>
<p>Nessy MacLeod, called the young mistress, had become my father's
secretary, and spent most of her time in his private room, a
privilege which enlarged her pride without improving her
manners.</p>
<p>Martin Conrad I did not see, for in reward for some success at
school the doctor had allowed him to spend his Easter holidays in
London in order to look at Nansen's ship, the <i>Fram</i>, which
had just then arrived in the Thames.</p>
<p>Hence it happened that though home made a certain tug at me,
with its familiar sights and sounds, and more than once I turned
with timid steps towards my father's busy room, intending to say,
"Please, father, don't send me back to school," I made no demur
when, six or seven days after the funeral, Aunt Bridget began to
prepare for my departure.</p>
<p>"There's odds of women," said Tommy the Mate, when I went into
the garden to say good bye to him "They're like sheep's broth, is
women. If there's a head and a heart in them they're good, and if
there isn't you might as well be supping hot water. Our Big Woman
is hot water&mdash;but she'll die for all."</p>
<p>Within a fortnight I was back at the Convent, and there the
Reverend Mother atoned to me for every neglect.</p>
<p>"I knew you would come back to me," she said, and from that hour
onward she seemed to be trying to make up to me for the mother I
had lost.</p>
<p>I became deeply devoted to her. As a consequence her spirit
became my spirit, and, little by little, the religious side of the
life of the Convent took complete possession of me.</p>
<p>At first I loved the church and its services because the
Reverend Mother loved them, and perhaps also for the sake of the
music, the incense, the flowers and the lights on the altar; but
after I had taken my communion, the mysteries of our religion took
hold of me&mdash;the Confessional with its sense of cleansing and
the unutterable sweetness of the Mass.</p>
<p>For a long time there was nothing to disturb this religious side
of my mind. My father never sent for me, and as often as the
holidays came round the Reverend Mother took me with her to her
country home at Nemi.</p>
<p>That was a beautiful place&mdash;a sweet white cottage, some
twenty kilometres from Rome, at the foot of Monte Cavo, in the
middle of the remains of a medi&aelig;val village which contained a
castle and a monastery, and had a little blue lake lying like an
emerald among the green and red of the grass and poppies in the
valley below.</p>
<p>In the hot months of summer the place was like a Paradise to me,
with its roses growing wild by the wayside; its green lizards
running on the rocks; its goats; its sheep; its vineyards; its
brown-faced boys in velvet, and its gleesome girls in smart red
petticoats and gorgeous outside stays; its shrines and its blazing
sunsets, which seemed to girdle the heavens with quivering bands of
purple and gold.</p>
<p>Years went by without my being aware of their going, for after a
while I became entirely happy.</p>
<p>I heard frequently from home. Occasionally it was from Betsy
Beauty, who had not much to say beyond stories of balls at
Government House, where she had danced with the young Lord Raa, and
of hunts at which she had ridden with him. More rarely it was from
Aunt Bridget, who usually began by complaining of the
ever-increasing cost of my convent clothes and ended with accounts
of her daughter's last new costume and how well she looked in
it.</p>
<p>From Nessy MacLeod and my father I never heard at all, but
Father Dan was my constant correspondent and he told me
everything.</p>
<p>First of my father himself&mdash;that he had carried out many of
his great enterprises, his marine works, electric railways,
drinking and dancing palaces, which had brought tens of thousands
of visitors and hundreds of thousands of pounds to Ellan, though
the good Father doubted the advantage of such innovations and
lamented the decline of piety which had followed on the lust for
wealth.</p>
<p>Next of Aunt Bridget&mdash;that she was bringing up her daughter
in the ways of worldly vanity and cherishing a serpent in her bosom
(meaning Nessy MacLeod) who would poison her heart some day.</p>
<p>Next, of Tommy the Mate&mdash;that he sent his "best respec's"
to the "lil-missy" but thought she was well out of the way of the
Big Woman who "was getting that highty-tighty" that "you couldn't
say Tom to a cat before her but she was agate of you to make it
Thomas."</p>
<p>Then of Martin Conrad&mdash;that he was at college "studying for
a doctor," but his heart was still at the North Pole and he was
"like a sea-gull in the nest of a wood pigeon," always longing to
be out on the wild waves.</p>
<p>Finally of the young Lord Raa&mdash;that the devil's dues must
be in the man, for after being "sent down" from Oxford he had
wasted his substance in riotous living in London and his guardian
had been heard to say he must marry a rich wife soon or his estates
would go to the hammer.</p>
<p>Such was the substance of the news that reached me over a period
of six years. Yet welcome as were Father Dan's letters the life
they described seemed less and less important to me as time went
on, for the outer world was slipping away from me altogether and I
was becoming more and more immersed in my spiritual exercises.</p>
<p>I spent much of my time reading religious books&mdash;the life
of Saint Teresa, the meditations of Saint Francis of Sales, and,
above all, the letters and prayers of our Blessed Margaret Mary
Alacoque, whose love of the Sacred Heart was like a flaming torch
to my excited spirit.</p>
<p>The soul of Rome, too, seemed to enter into my soul&mdash;not
the new Rome, for of that I knew nothing, but the old Rome, the
holy city, that could speak to me in the silence of the night
within the walls of my convent-school, with its bells of the
Dominican and Franciscan monasteries on either side, its stories of
miracles performed on the sick and dying by the various shrines of
the Madonna, its accounts of the vast multitudes of the faithful
who came from all ends of the earth to the ceremonials at St.
Peter's, and, above all, its sense of the immediate presence of the
Pope, half a mile away, the Vicar and mouthpiece of God
Himself.</p>
<p>The end of it all was that I wished to become a nun. I said
nothing of my desire to anybody, not even to the Reverend Mother,
but day by day my resolution grew.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was natural that the orphaned and homeless girl
should plunge with all this passion into the aurora of a new
spiritual life; but when I think how my nature was made for love,
human love, the love of husband and children, I cannot but wonder
with a thrill of the heart whether my mother in heaven, who, while
she was on earth, had fought so hard with my father for the body of
her child, was now fighting with him for her soul.</p>
<p>I was just eighteen years of age when my desire to become a nun
reached its highest point, and then received its final
overthrow.</p>
<p>Mildred Bankes, who had returned to Rome, and was living as a
novice with the Little Sisters of the Poor, was about to make her
vows, and the Reverend Mother took me to see the ceremony.</p>
<p>Never shall I forget the effect of it. The sweet summer morning,
tingling with snow-white sunshine, the little white chapel in the
garden of the Convent, covered with flowers, the altar with its
lighted tapers, the friends from without clad in gay costumes as
for a festival, the bishop in his bright vestments, and then,
Mildred herself, dressed as a bride in a beautiful white gown with
a long white veil and attended by other novices as bridesmaids.</p>
<p>It was just like a marriage to look upon, except for the absence
of a visible bridegroom, the invisible one being Christ. And the
taking of the vows was like a marriage service too&mdash;only more
solemn and sacred and touching&mdash;the bride receiving the ring
on her finger, and promising to serve and worship her celestial
lover from that day forward, for better for worse, for richer for
poorer, in sickness and in health, as long as life should last and
through the eternity that was to follow it.</p>
<p>I cried all through the ceremony for sheer joy of its
loveliness; and when it was over and we went into the refectory,
and Mildred told me she was returning to England to work among the
fallen girls of London, I vowed in my heart, though I hardly
understood what she was going to do, that I would follow her
example.</p>
<p>It was something of a jar to go back into the streets, so full
of noise and bustle; and all the way home with the Reverend Mother
I was forming the resolution of telling her that very night that I
meant to be a nun, for, stirred to the depths of my soul by what I
had seen and remembering what my poor mother had wished for me, I
determined that no other life would I live under any
circumstances.</p>
<p>Then came the shock.</p>
<p>As we drew up at our door a postman was delivering letters. One
of them was for the Reverend Mother and I saw in a moment that it
was in my father's handwriting. She read it in silence, and in
silence she handed it to me. It ran:</p>
<p>"<i>Madam</i>,</p>
<p>"<i>I have come to Rome to take back my daughter. I believe her
education will now be finished, and I reckon the time has arrived
to prepare her for the change in life that is before her</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>The Bishop of our diocese has come with me, and we propose
to pay our respects to you at ten o'clock prompt to-morrow
morning</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Yours, Madam</i>,</p>
<p>"DANIEL O'NEILL."</p>

<h2><a name="NINETEENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"NINETEENTH_CHAPTER"></a>NINETEENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I saw, as by a flash of light, what was before me, and my whole
soul rose in rebellion against it. That my father after all the
years during which he had neglected me, should come to me now, when
my plans were formed, and change the whole current of my life, was
an outrage&mdash;an iniquity. It might be his right&mdash;his
natural right&mdash;but if so his natural right was a spiritual
wrong&mdash;and I would resist it&mdash;to my last breath and my
last hour I would resist it.</p>
<p>Such were the brave thoughts with which I passed that night, but
at ten o'clock next morning, when I was summoned to meet my father
himself, it was on trembling limbs and with a quivering heart that
I went down to the Reverend Mother's room.</p>
<p>Except that his hair was whiter than before my father was not
much changed. He rose as I entered, saying, "Here she is herself,"
and when I went up to him he put his hands on my shoulders and
looked into my face.</p>
<p>"Quite a little Italian woman grown! Like your mother though,"
he said, and then speaking over my head to the Bishop, who sat on
the other side of the room, he added:</p>
<p>"Guess this will do, Bishop, eh?"</p>
<p>"Perfectly," said the Bishop.</p>
<p>I was colouring in confusion at the continued scrutiny, with a
feeling of being looked over for some unexplained purpose, when the
Reverend Mother called me, and turning to go to her I saw, by the
look of pain on her face that she, too, had been hurt by it.</p>
<p>She put me to sit on a stool by the side of her chair, and
taking my right hand she laid it in her lap and held it there
during the whole of the interview.</p>
<p>The Bishop, whom I had never seen before, was the first to
speak. He was a type of the fashionable ecclesiastic, suave,
smiling, faultlessly dressed in silk soutane and silver buckled
shoes, and wearing a heavy gold chain with a jewelled cross.</p>
<p>"Reverend Mother," he said, "you would gather from Mr. O'Neill's
letter that he wishes to remove his daughter immediately&mdash;I
presume there will be no difficulty in his doing so?"</p>
<p>The Reverend Mother did not speak, but I think she must have
bent her head.</p>
<p>"Naturally," said the Bishop, "there will be a certain delay
while suitable clothes are being made for her, but I have no doubt
you will give Mr. O'Neill your help in these preparations."</p>
<p>My head was down, and I did not see if the Reverend Mother bowed
again. But the two gentlemen, apparently satisfied with her
silence, began to talk of the best date for my removal, and just
when I was quivering with fear that without a word of protest I was
to be taken away, the Reverend Mother said:</p>
<p>"Monsignor!"</p>
<p>"Reverend Mother!"</p>
<p>"You are aware that this child"&mdash;here she patted my
trembling hand&mdash;"has been with me for ten years?"</p>
<p>"I am given to understand so."</p>
<p>"And that during that time she has only once been home?"</p>
<p>"I was not aware&mdash;but no doubt it is as you say."</p>
<p>"In short, that during the greater part of her life she has been
left to my undivided care?"</p>
<p>"You have been very good to her, very, and I'm sure her family
are extremely grateful."</p>
<p>"In that case, Monsignor, doesn't it seem to you that I am
entitled to know why she is being so suddenly taken away from me,
and what is the change in life which Mr. O'Neill referred to in his
letter?"</p>
<p>The smile which had been playing upon the Bishop's face was
smitten away from it by that question, and he looked anxiously
across at my father.</p>
<p>"Tell her," said my father, and then, while my heart thumped in
my bosom and the Reverend Mother stroked my hand to compose me, the
Bishop gave a brief explanation.</p>
<p>The time had not come when it would be prudent to be more
definite, but he might say that Mr. O'Neill was trying to arrange a
happy and enviable future for his daughter, and therefore he wished
her to return home to prepare for it.</p>
<p>"Does that mean marriage?" said the Reverend Mother.</p>
<p>"It may be so. I am not quite prepared to . . ."</p>
<p>"And that a husband has already been found for her?"</p>
<p>"That too perhaps. I will not say . . ."</p>
<p>"Monsignor," said the Reverend Mother, sitting up with dignity
"is that fair?"</p>
<p>"Fair?"</p>
<p>"Is it fair that after ten years in which her father has done
nothing for her, he should determine what her life is to be,
without regard to her wish and will?"</p>
<p>I raised my eyes and saw that the Bishop looked aghast.</p>
<p>"Reverend Mother, you surprise me," he said. "Since when has a
father ceased to be the natural guardian of his child? Has he not
been so since the beginning of the world? Doesn't the Church itself
build its laws on that foundation?"</p>
<p>"Does it?" said the Reverend Mother shortly. And then (I could
feel her hand trembling as she spoke): "Some of its servants do, I
know. But when did the Church say that anybody&mdash;no matter
who&mdash;a father or anybody else&mdash;should take the soul of
another, and control it and govern it, and put it in prison? . .
."</p>
<p>"My good lady," said the Bishop, "would you call it putting the
girl in prison to marry her into an illustrious family, to give her
an historic name, to surround her with the dignity and distinction
. . ."</p>
<p>"Bishop," said my father, raising his hand, "I guess it's my
right to butt in here, isn't it?"</p>
<p>I saw that my father's face had been darkening while the
Reverend Mother spoke, and now, rolling his heavy body in his chair
so as to face her, he said:</p>
<p>"Excuse me, ma'am, but when you say I've done nothing for my gel
here I suppose you'll allow I've kept her and educated her?"</p>
<p>"You've kept and educated your dogs and horses, also, I dare
say, but do you claim the same rights over a human being?"</p>
<p>"I do, ma'am&mdash;I think I do. And when the human being
happens to be my own daughter I don't allow that anybody else has
anything to say."</p>
<p>"If her mother were alive would <i>she</i> have nothing to
say?"</p>
<p>I thought my father winced at that word, but he answered:</p>
<p>"Her mother would agree to anything I thought best."</p>
<p>"Her mother, so far as I can see, was a most unselfish, most
submissive, most unhappy woman," said the Reverend Mother.</p>
<p>My father glanced quickly at me and then, after a moment, he
said:</p>
<p>"I'm obliged to you, ma'am, much obliged. But as I'm not a man
to throw words away I'll ask you to tell me what all this means.
Does it mean that you've made plans of your own for my daughter
without consulting me?"</p>
<p>"No, sir."</p>
<p>"Then perhaps it means that the gel herself . . ."</p>
<p>"That may be so or not&mdash;I cannot say. But when you sent
your daughter to a convent-school . . ."</p>
<p>"Wrong, ma'am, wrong for once. It was my wife's sister&mdash;who
thinks the gel disobedient and rebellious and unruly . . ."</p>
<p>"Then your wife's sister is either a very stupid or a very
bad-hearted woman."</p>
<p>"Ma'am?"</p>
<p>"I have known your daughter longer than she has, and there isn't
a word of truth in what she says."</p>
<p>It was as much as I could do not to fall on the Reverend
Mother's neck, but I clung to her hand with a convulsive grasp.</p>
<p>"May be so, ma'am, may be no," said my father. "But when you
talk about my sending my daughter to a convent-school I would have
you know that I've been so busy with my business . . ."</p>
<p>"That you haven't had time to take care of the most precious
thing God gave you."</p>
<p>"Ma'am," said my father, rising to his feet, "may I ask what
right you have to speak to me as if . . ."</p>
<p>"The right of one who for ten years has been a mother to your
motherless child, sir, while you have neglected and forgotten
her."</p>
<p>At that my father, whose bushy eyebrows were heavily contracted,
turned to the Bishop.</p>
<p>"Bishop," he said, "is this what I've been paying my money for?
Ten years' fees, and middling high ones too, I'm thinking?"</p>
<p>And then the Bishop, apparently hoping to make peace, said
suavely:</p>
<p>"But aren't we crossing the river before we reach the bridge?
The girl herself may have no such objections. Have you?" he asked,
turning to me.</p>
<p>I was trembling more than ever now, and at first I could not
reply.</p>
<p>"Don't you wish to go back home with your father?"</p>
<p>"No, sir," I answered.</p>
<p>"And why not, please?"</p>
<p>"Because my father's home is no home to me&mdash;because my aunt
has always been unkind to me, and because my father has never cared
for me or protected me, and because . . ."</p>
<p>"Well, what else?"</p>
<p>"Because . . . because I wish to become a nun."</p>
<p>There was silence for a moment, and then my father broke into
bitter laughter.</p>
<p>"So that's it, is it? I thought as much. You want to go into
partnership with the Mother in the nun business, eh?"</p>
<p>"My mother wished me to become a nun, and I wish it myself,
sir."</p>
<p>"Your mother was a baby&mdash;that's what she was."</p>
<p>"My mother was an angel, sir," I said, bridling up, "and when
she was dying she hoped I should become a nun, and I can never
become anything else under any circumstance."</p>
<p>"Bah!" said my father, with a contemptuous lift of the hand, and
then turning to the Reverend Mother he said:</p>
<p>"Hark here, ma'am. There's an easy way and a hard way in most
everything. I take the easy way first, and if it won't work I take
the hard way next, and then it's stiff pulling for the people who
pull against me. I came to Rome to take my daughter home. I don't
feel called upon to explain why I want to take her home, or what
I'm going to do with her when I get her there. I believe I've got
the rights of a father to do what I mean to do, and that it will be
an ugly business for anybody who aids and abets my daughter in
resisting her father's will. So I'll leave her here a week longer,
and when I come back, I'll expect her to be ready and waiting and
willing&mdash;ready and waiting and willing, mind you&mdash;to go
along with me."</p>
<p>After saying this my father faced about and with his heavy flat
step went out of the room, whereupon the Bishop bowed to the
Reverend Mother and followed him.</p>
<p>My heart was by this time in fierce rebellion&mdash;all that the
pacifying life of the convent-school had done for me in ten years
being suddenly swept away&mdash;and I cried:</p>
<p>"I won't do it! I won't do it!"</p>
<p>But I had seen that the Reverend Mother's face had suddenly
become very white while my father spoke to her at the end and now
she said, in a timid, almost frightened tone:</p>
<p>"Mary, we'll go out to Nemi to-day. I have something to say to
you."</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="TWENTIETH_CHAPTER" id=
"TWENTIETH_CHAPTER"></a>TWENTIETH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>In the late afternoon of the same day we were sitting together
for the last time on the terrace of the Reverend Mother's
villa.</p>
<p>It was a peaceful evening, a sweet and holy time. Not a leaf was
stirring, not a breath of wind was in the air; but the voice of a
young boy, singing a love-song, came up from somewhere among the
rocky ledges of the vineyards below, and while the bell of the
monastic church behind us was ringing the Ave Maria, the far-off
bell of the convent church at Gonzano was answering from the other
side of the lake&mdash;like angels calling to each other from long
distances in the sky.</p>
<p>"Mary," said the Reverend Mother, "I want to tell you a story.
It is the story of my own life&mdash;mine and my sister's and my
father's."</p>
<p>I was sitting by her side and she was holding my hand in her
lap, and patting it, as she had done during the interview of the
morning.</p>
<p>"They say the reason so few women become nuns is that a woman is
too attached to her home to enter the holy life until she has
suffered shipwreck in the world. That may be so with most women. It
was not so with me.</p>
<p>"My father was what is called a self-made man. But his fortune
did not content him. He wanted to found a family. If he had had a
son this might have been easy. Having only two daughters, he saw no
way but that of marrying one of us into the Italian nobility.</p>
<p>"My sister was the first to disappoint him. She fell in love
with a young Roman musician. The first time the young man asked for
my sister he was contemptuously refused; the second time he was
insulted; the third time he was flung out of the house. His nature
was headstrong and passionate, and so was my father's. If either
had been different the result might not have been the same. Yet who
knows? Who can say?"</p>
<p>The Reverend Mother paused for a moment. The boy's voice in the
vineyard was going on.</p>
<p>"To remove my sister from the scene of temptation my father took
her from Rome to our villa in the hills above Albano. But the young
musician followed her. Since my father would not permit him to
marry her he was determined that she should fly with him, and when
she hesitated to do so he threatened her. If she did not meet him
at a certain hour on a certain night my father would be dead in the
morning."</p>
<p>The Reverend Mother paused again. The boy's voice had ceased;
the daylight was dying out.</p>
<p>"My sister could not bring herself to sacrifice either her
father or her lover. Hence she saw only one way left&mdash;to
sacrifice herself."</p>
<p>"Herself?"</p>
<p>The Reverend Mother patted my hand. "Isn't that what women in
tragic circumstances are always doing?" she said.</p>
<p>"By some excuse&mdash;I don't know what&mdash;she persuaded our
father to change rooms with her that night&mdash;he going upstairs
to her bedroom in the tower, and she to his on the ground floor at
the back, opening on to the garden and the pine forest that goes up
the hill.</p>
<p>"What happened after that nobody ever knew exactly. In the
middle of the night the servants heard two pistol shots, and next
morning my sister was found dead&mdash;shot to the heart through an
open window as she lay in my father's bed.</p>
<p>"The authorities tried in vain to trace the criminal. Only one
person had any idea of his identity. That was my father, and in his
fierce anger he asked himself what he ought to do in order to
punish the man who had killed his daughter.</p>
<p>"Then a strange thing happened. On the day before the funeral
the young musician walked into my father's room. His face was white
and wasted, and his eyes were red and swollen. He had come to ask
if he might be allowed to be one of those to carry the coffin. My
father consented. 'I'll leave him alone,' he thought. 'The man is
punished enough.'</p>
<p>"All the people of Albano came to the funeral and there was not
a dry eye as the cort&egrave;ge passed from our chapel to the
grave. Everybody knew the story of my sister's hopeless love, but
only two in the world knew the secret of her tragic death&mdash;her
young lover, who was sobbing aloud as he staggered along with her
body on his shoulder, and her old father, who was walking
bareheaded and in silence, behind him."</p>
<p>My heart was beating audibly and the Reverend Mother stroked my
hand to compose me&mdash;perhaps to compose herself also. It was
now quite dark, the stars were coming out, and the bells of the two
monasteries on opposite sides of the lake were ringing the first
hour of night.</p>
<p>"That's my sister's story, Mary," said the Reverend Mother after
a while, "and the moral of my own is the same, though the incidents
are different.</p>
<p>"I was now my father's only child and all his remaining hopes
centred in me. So he set himself to find a husband for me before
the time came when I should form an attachment for myself. His
choice fell on a middle-aged Roman noble of distinguished but
impoverished family.</p>
<p>"'He has a great name; you will have a great fortune&mdash;what
more do you want?' said my father.</p>
<p>"We were back in Rome by this time, and there&mdash;at school or
elsewhere&mdash;I had formed the conviction that a girl must
passionately love the man she marries, and I did not love the Roman
noble. I had also been led to believe that a girl should be the
first and only passion of the man who marries her, and, young as I
was, I knew that my middle-aged lover had had other domestic
relations.</p>
<p>"Consequently I demurred, but my father threatened and stormed,
and then, remembering my sister's fate, I pretended to agree, and I
was formally engaged.</p>
<p>"I never meant to keep my promise, and I began to think out
schemes by which to escape from it. Only one way seemed open to me
then, and cherishing the thought of it in secret, I waited and
watched and made preparations for carrying out my purpose.</p>
<p>"At length the moment came to me. It was mid-Lent, and a masked
ball was given by my fianc&eacute;'s friends in one of the old
Roman palaces. I can see it still&mdash;the great hall, ablaze with
glowing frescoes, beautiful Venetian candelabras, gilded furniture,
red and yellow damask and velvet, and then the throng of handsome
men in many uniforms and beautiful women with rows of pearls
falling from their naked throats.</p>
<p>"I had dressed myself as a Bacchante in a white tunic
embroidered in gold, with bracelets on my bare arms, a tiger-skin
band over my forehead, and a cluster of grapes in my hair.</p>
<p>"I danced every dance, I remember, most of them with my
middle-aged lover, and I suppose no one seemed so gay and happy and
heedless. At three o'clock in the morning I returned home in my
father's carriage. At six I had entered a convent.</p>
<p>"Nobody in the outer world ever knew what had become of me, and
neither did I know what happened at home after I left it. The rule
of the convent was very strict. Sometimes, after morning prayers,
the Superior would say, 'The mother of one of you is
dead&mdash;pray for her soul,' and that was all we ever heard of
the world outside.</p>
<p>"But nature is a mighty thing, my child, and after five years I
became restless and unhappy. I began to have misgivings about my
vocation, but the Mother, who was wise and human, saw what was
going on in my heart. 'You are thinking about your father,' she
said, 'that he is growing old, and needing a daughter to take care
of him. Go out, and nurse him, and then come back to your cell and
pray.'</p>
<p>"I went, but when I reached my father's house a great shock
awaited me. A strange man was in the porter's lodge, and our
beautiful palace was let out in apartments. My father was
dead&mdash;three years dead and buried. After my disappearance he
had shut himself up in his shame and grief, for, little as I had
suspected it and hard and cruel as I had thought him, he had really
and truly loved me. During his last days his mind had failed him
and he had given away all his fortune&mdash;scattered it, no one
knew how, as something that was quite useless&mdash;and then he
died, alone and broken-hearted."</p>
<p>That was the end of the Reverend Mother's narrative. She did not
try to explain or justify or condemn her own or her sister's
conduct, neither did she attempt to apply the moral of her story to
my own circumstances. She left me to do that for myself.</p>
<p>I had been spell-bound while she spoke, creeping closer and
closer to her until my head was on her breast.</p>
<p>For some time longer we sat like this in the soft Italian night,
while the fire-flies came out in clouds among the unseen flowers of
the garden and the dark air seemed to be alive with sparks of
light.</p>
<p>When the time came to go to bed the Reverend Mother took me to
my room, and after some cheerful words she left me. But hardly had
I lain down, shaken to the heart's core by what I had heard, and
telling myself that the obedience of a daughter to her father,
whatever he might demand of her, was an everlasting and
irreversible duty, imposed by no human law-giver, and that marriage
was a necessity, which was forced upon most women by a mysterious
and unyielding law of God, when the door opened and the Reverend
Mother, with a lamp in her hand, came in again.</p>
<p>"Mary," she said, "I forgot to tell you that I am leaving the
Sacred Heart. The Sisters of my old convent have asked me to go
back as Superior. I have obtained permission to do so and am going
shortly, so that in any case we should have been parted soon. It is
the Convent of. . . ."</p>
<p>Here she gave me the name of a private society of cloistered
nuns in the heart of Rome.</p>
<p>"I hope you will write to me as often as possible, and come to
see me whenever you can. . . . And if it should ever occur that . .
. but no, I will not think of that. Marriage is a sacred tie, too,
and under proper conditions God blesses and hallows it."</p>
<p>With that she left me in the darkness. The church bell was
ringing, the monks of the Passionist monastery were getting up for
their midnight offices.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="TWENTY_FIRST_CHAPTER" id=
"TWENTY_FIRST_CHAPTER"></a>TWENTY-FIRST CHAPTER</h2>
<p>A week later I was living with my father in the Hotel Europa on
the edge of the Piazza di Spagna.</p>
<p>He was kinder to me than he had ever been before, but he did not
tell me what the plans were which he had formed for my future, and
I was left to discover them for myself.</p>
<p>Our apartment was constantly visited by
ecclesiastics&mdash;Monsignori, Archbishops, even one of the
Cardinals of the Propaganda, brought there by Bishop Walsh (the
Bishop of our own diocese), and I could not help but hear portions
of their conversation.</p>
<p>"It will be difficult, extremely difficult," the Cardinal would
say. "Such marriages are not encouraged by the Church, which holds
that they are usually attended by the worst consequences to both
wife and husband. Still&mdash;under the exceptional
circumstances&mdash;that the bridegroom's family was Catholic
before it was Protestant&mdash;it is possible, just possible. . .
."</p>
<p>"Cardinal," my father would answer, while his strong face was
darkening, "excuse me, sir, but I'm kind of curious to get the hang
of this business. Either it can be done or it can't. If it can,
we'll just sail in and do it. But if it can't, I believe I'll go
home quick and spend my money another way."</p>
<p>Then there would be earnest assurances that in the end all would
be right, only Rome moved slowly, and it would be necessary to have
patience and wait.</p>
<p>My father waited three weeks, and meantime he occupied himself
in seeing the sights of the old city.</p>
<p>But the mighty remains which are the luminous light-houses of
the past&mdash;the Forum with the broken columns of its dead
centuries; the Coliseum with its gigantic ruins, like the desolate
crater of a moon; the Campagna with its hollow, crumbling tombs and
shattered aqueducts,&mdash;only vexed and irritated him.</p>
<p>"Guess if I had my way," he said, "I would just clean out this
old stone-yard of monuments to dead men, and make it more fit for
living ones."</p>
<p>At length the Bishop came to say that the necessary business had
been completed, and that to mark its satisfactory settlement the
Pope had signified his willingness to receive in private audience
both my father and myself.</p>
<p>This threw me into a state of the greatest nervousness, for I
had begun to realise that my father's business concerned myself, so
that when, early the following morning (clad according to
instructions, my father in evening dress and I in a long black
mantilla), we set out for the Vatican, I was in a condition of
intense excitement.</p>
<p>What happened after we got out of the carriage at the bronze
gate near St. Peter's I can only describe from a vague and feverish
memory. I remember going up a great staircase, past soldiers in
many-coloured coats, into a vast corridor, where there were other
soldiers in other costumes. I remember going on and on, through
salon after salon, each larger and more luxurious than the last,
and occupied by guards still more gorgeously dressed than the
guards we had left behind. I remember coming at length to a door at
which a Chamberlain, wearing a sword, knelt and knocked softly, and
upon its being opened announced our names. And then I remember that
after all this grandeur as of a medi&aelig;val court I found myself
in a plain room like a library with a simple white figure before
me, and . . . I was in the presence of the Holy Father himself.</p>
<p>Can I ever forget that moment?</p>
<p>I had always been taught in the Convent to think of the Pope
with a reverence only second to that which was due to the Saints,
so at first I thought I should faint, and how I reached the Holy
Father's feet I do not know. I only know that he was very sweet and
kind to me, holding out the delicate white hand on which he wore
the fisherman's emerald ring, and smoothing my head after I had
kissed it.</p>
<p>When I recovered myself sufficiently to look up I saw that he
was an old man, with a very pale and saintly face; and when he
spoke it was in such a soft and fatherly voice that I loved and
worshipped him.</p>
<p>"So this is the little lady," he said, "who is to be the
instrument in the hands of Providence in bringing back an erring
family into the folds of Mother Church."</p>
<p>Somebody answered him, and then he spoke to me about marriage,
saying it was a holy state, instituted by the Almighty under a
natural law and sanctioned by our divine Redeemer into the dignity
of a Sacrament, so that those who entered it might live together in
peace and love.</p>
<p>"It is a spiritual and sacred union, my child," he said, "a type
of the holy mystery of Christ's relation to His Church."</p>
<p>Then he told me I was to make the best possible preparation for
marriage in order to obtain the abundant graces of God, and to
approach the altar only after penance and communion.</p>
<p>"And when you leave the church, my daughter," he said, "do not
profane the day of your marriage by any sinful thought or act, but
remember to bear yourself as if Jesus Christ Himself were with you,
as He was at the marriage-feast in Cana of Galilee."</p>
<p>Then he warned me that when I entered into the solemn contract
of holy matrimony I was to do so in the full consciousness that it
could not be broken but by death.</p>
<p>"Whom God has joined together let no man put
asunder&mdash;remember that, too, my daughter."</p>
<p>Finally he said something about children&mdash;that a Catholic
marrying a person of another religion must not enter into any
agreement whereby any of her children should be brought up in any
other than the Catholic faith.</p>
<p>After that, and something said to my father which I cannot
recall, he gave me his blessing, in words so beautiful and a voice
so sweet that it fell on me like the soft breeze that comes out of
the rising sun on a summer morning.</p>
<p>"May the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob
be with you, my daughter. May your marriage be a yoke of love and
peace, and may you see your children's children to the third and
fourth generation."</p>
<p>Then he raised me to my feet, and at a touch from the
Chamberlain, I backed out of the room.</p>
<p>When the door had closed on me I drew a deep breath, feeling as
if I had come out of the Holy of Holies, and when I reached the
Piazza of St. Peter's and came again upon the sight and sound of
common things&mdash;the cabs and electric cars&mdash;it was the
same as if I had suddenly descended from heaven to earth.</p>
<p>After my audience with the Pope, following on the Reverend
Mother's story, all my objections to marriage had gone, and I
wished to tell my father so, but an opportunity did not arise until
late the same night and then it was he who was the first to
speak.</p>
<p>Being in good spirits, after a dinner to the ecclesiastics, he
said, as soon as his guests had gone&mdash;speaking in the tone of
one who believed he was doing a great thing for me&mdash;</p>
<p>"Mary, matters are not quite settled yet, but you might as well
know right here what we're trying to fix up for you."</p>
<p>Then he told me.</p>
<p>I was to marry the young Lord Raa!</p>
<p>I was stunned. It was just as if the power of thought had been
smitten out of me.</p>

<h2><a name="TWENTY_SECOND_CHAPTER" id=
"TWENTY_SECOND_CHAPTER"></a>TWENTY-SECOND CHAPTER</h2>
<p>That night, and during the greater part of the following day, I
felt, without quite knowing why, as if I were living under the dark
cloud of a gathering thunderstorm. All my fear of the world, and my
desire to escape from it, had fallen upon me afresh. Hence it was
not altogether by the blind leading of fate that half an hour
before Ave Maria I entered the church of the Convent which the
Reverend Mother had given me the name of.</p>
<p>The church was empty when I pushed past the leather hanging that
covered the door, but the sacristan was lighting the candles for
Benediction, so I went up to the bronze screen, the Cancello, that
divides the public part from the part occupied by the Sisters, and
knelt on the nearest step.</p>
<p>After a while the church-bell rang overhead, and then (the
congregation having gathered in the meantime) the nuns came in by
way of a corridor which seemed to issue out of the darkness from
under a figure of the Virgin and Child.</p>
<p>They were all in white, snow-white from head to foot, with a
glimmer of blue scapular beneath their outer garment, and they wore
long thick veils which entirely concealed their features when they
entered but were raised when they reached their seats and faced the
altar.</p>
<p>Familiar as I was with similar scenes this one moved me as I had
never before been moved&mdash;the silent white figures, with hands
clasped on their breasts, coming in one by one with noiseless and
unhurried footsteps, like a line of wraiths from another world.</p>
<p>But a still deeper emotion was to come to me.</p>
<p>As the last of the nuns entered, the Superior as I knew she
would be, I recognised her instantly. It was my own Reverend Mother
herself; and when, after kneeling to the altar, she came down to
her seat nearest to the screen, immediately in front of the place
where I knelt, I knew by the tremor of the clasped hands which held
the rosary, that she had seen and recognised me.</p>
<p>I trembled and my heart thumped against my breast.</p>
<p>Then the priest entered and the Litany began. It was sung
throughout. Almost the whole of the service was sung. Never had
Benediction seemed so beautiful, so pathetic, so appealing, so
irresistible.</p>
<p>By the time the <i>Tantum ergo</i> had been reached and the
sweet female voices, over the soft swell of the organ, were rising
to the vaulted roof in sorrowful reparation for the sins of all
sinners in the world who did not pray for themselves, the religious
life was calling to me as it had never called before.</p>
<p>"Come away from the world," it seemed to say. "Obedience to your
heavenly Father cancels all duty to your earthly one. Leave
everything you fear behind you, and find peace and light and
love."</p>
<p>The service was over, the nuns had dropped their veils and gone
out as slowly and noiselessly as they had come in (the last of them
with her head down): the sacristan with his long rod was
extinguishing the candles on the altar; the church was growing dark
and a lay-sister in black was rattling a bunch of keys at the door
behind me before I moved from my place beside the rails.</p>
<p>Then I awoke as from a dream, and looking longingly back at the
dark corridor down which the nuns had disappeared, I was turning to
go when I became aware that a young man was standing beside me and
smiling into my face.</p>
<p>"Mally," he said very softly, and he held out his hand.</p>
<p>Something in the voice made me giddy, something in the blue eyes
made me tremble. I looked at him but did not speak.</p>
<p>"Don't you know me, Mally?" he said.</p>
<p>I felt as if a rosy veil were falling over my face and neck. A
flood of joy was sweeping through me. At last I knew who it
was.</p>
<p>It was Martin Conrad, grown to be a man, a tall, powerful, manly
man, but with the same face still&mdash;an elusive ghost of the
boy's face I used to look up to and love.</p>
<p>A few minutes later we were out on the piazza in front of the
church, and with a nervous rush of joyous words he was telling me
what had brought him to Rome.</p>
<p>Having just "scraped through" his examinations, and taken his
degree&mdash;couldn't have done so if the examiners had not been
"jolly good" to him&mdash;he had heard that Lieut. . . .&mdash;was
going down to the great ice barrier that bounds the South Pole, to
investigate the sources of winds and tides, so he had offered
himself as doctor to the expedition and been accepted.</p>
<p>Sailing from the Thames ten days ago they had put into Naples
that morning for coal, and taking advantage of the opportunity he
had run up to Rome, remembering that I was at school here, but
never expecting to see me, and coming upon me by the merest
accident in the world&mdash;something having said to him, "Let's go
in here and look at this queer old church."</p>
<p>He had to leave to-morrow at two, though, having to sail the
same night, but of course it would be luck to go farther south than
Charcot and make another attack on the Antarctic night.</p>
<p>I could see that life was full of faith and hope and all good
things for him, and remembering some episodes of the past I
said:</p>
<p>"So you are going 'asploring' in earnest at last?"</p>
<p>"At last," he answered, and we looked into each other's eyes and
laughed as we stood together on the church steps, with little
tender waves of feeling from our childhood sweeping to our
feet.</p>
<p>"And you?" he said. "You look just the same. I knew you
instantly. Yet you are changed too. So grown and so . . . so
wonderfully. . . ."</p>
<p>I knew what he meant to say, and being too much of a child to
pretend not to know, and too much of a woman (notwithstanding my
nun-like impulses) not to find joy in it, I said I was glad.</p>
<p>"You've left the Convent, I see. When did that happen?"</p>
<p>I told him three weeks ago&mdash;that my father had come for me
and we were going back to Ellan.</p>
<p>"And then? What are you going to do then?" he asked.</p>
<p>For a moment I felt ashamed to answer, but at last I told him
that I was going home to be married.</p>
<p>"Married? When? To whom?"</p>
<p>I said I did not know when, but it was to be to the young Lord
Raa.</p>
<p>"Raa? Did you say Raa? That . . . Good G&mdash;&mdash; But
surely you know. . . ."</p>
<p>He did not finish what he was going to say, so I told him I did
not know anything, not having seen Lord Raa since I came to school,
and everything having been arranged for me by my father.</p>
<p>"Not seen him since . . . everything arranged by your
father?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Then he asked me abruptly where I was staying, and when I told
him he said he would walk back with me to the hotel.</p>
<p>His manner had suddenly changed, and several times as we walked
together up the Tritoni and along the Du Marcelli he began to say
something and then stopped.</p>
<p>"Surely your father knows. . . ."</p>
<p>"If he does, I cannot possibly understand. . . ."</p>
<p>I did not pay as much attention to his broken exclamations as I
should have done but for the surprise and confusion of coming so
suddenly upon him again; and when, as we reached the hotel, he
said:</p>
<p>"I wonder if your father will allow me to speak. . . ."</p>
<p>"I'm sure he'll be delighted," I said, and then, in my great
impatience, I ran upstairs ahead of him and burst into my father's
room, crying:</p>
<p>"Father, whom do you think I have brought to see
you&mdash;look!"</p>
<p>To my concern and discomfiture my father's reception of Martin
was very cool, and at first he did not even seem to know him.</p>
<p>"You don't remember me, sir?" said Martin.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid I can't just place you," said my father.</p>
<p>After I had made them known to each other they sat talking about
the South Pole expedition, but it was a chill and cheerless
interview, and after a few minutes Martin rose to go.</p>
<p>"I find it kind of hard to figure you fellows out," said my
father. "No money that I know of has ever been made in the Unknown,
as you call it, and if you discover both Poles I don't just see how
they're to be worth a two-cent stamp to you. But you know best, so
good-bye and good luck to you!"</p>
<p>I went out to the lift with Martin, who asked if he could take
me for a walk in the morning. I answered yes, and inquired what
hour he would call for me.</p>
<p>"Twelve o'clock," he replied, and I said that would suit me
exactly.</p>
<p>The Bishop came to dine with us that night, and after dinner,
when I had gone to the window to look out over the city for the
three lights on the Loggia of the Vatican, he and my father talked
together for a long time in a low tone. They were still talking
when I left them to go to bed.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="TWENTY_THIRD_CHAPTER" id=
"TWENTY_THIRD_CHAPTER"></a>TWENTY-THIRD CHAPTER</h2>
<p>At breakfast next morning my father told me that something
unexpected had occurred to require that we should return home
immediately, and therefore he had sent over to Cook's for seats by
the noon express.</p>
<p>I was deeply disappointed, but I knew my father too well to
demur, so I slipped away to my room and sent a letter to Martin,
explaining the change in our plans and saying good-bye to him.</p>
<p>When we reached the station, however, I found Martin waiting on
the platform in front of the compartment that was labelled with our
name.</p>
<p>I thought my father was even more brusque with him than before,
and the Bishop, who was to travel with us, was curt almost to
rudeness. But Martin did not seem to mind that this morning, for
his lower lip had the stiff setting which I had seen in it when he
was a boy, and after I stepped into the carriage he stepped in
after me, leaving the two men on the platform.</p>
<p>"Shall you be long away?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Too long unfortunately. Six months, nine&mdash;perhaps twelve,
worse luck! Wish I hadn't to go at all," he answered.</p>
<p>I was surprised and asked why, whereupon he stammered some
excuse, and then said abruptly:</p>
<p>"I suppose you'll not be married for some time at all
events?"</p>
<p>I told him I did not know, everything depending on my
father.</p>
<p>"Anyhow, you'll see and hear for yourself when you reach home,
and then perhaps you'll. . . ."</p>
<p>I answered that I should have to do what my father desired,
being a girl, and therefore. . . .</p>
<p>"But surely a girl has some rights of her own," he said, and
then I was silent and a little ashamed, having a sense of female
helplessness which I had never felt before and could find no words
for.</p>
<p>"I'll write to your father," he said, and just at that moment
the bell rang, and my father came into the compartment, saying:</p>
<p>"Now then, young man, if you don't want to be taken up to the
North Pole instead of going down to the South one. . . ."</p>
<p>"That's all right, sir. Don't you trouble about <i>me</i>. I can
take care of myself," said Martin.</p>
<p>Something in his tone must have said more than his words to my
father and the Bishop, for I saw that they looked at each other
with surprise.</p>
<p>Then the bell rang again, the engine throbbed, and Martin said,
"Good-bye! Good-bye!"</p>
<p>While the train moved out of the station he stood bareheaded on
the platform with such a woebegone face that looking back at him my
throat began to hurt me as it used to do when I was a child.</p>
<p>I was very sad that day as we travelled north. My adopted
country had become dear to me during my ten years' exile from home,
and I thought I was seeing the last of my beautiful Italy, crowned
with sunshine and decked with flowers.</p>
<p>But there was another cause of my sadness, and that was the
thought of Martin's uneasiness about my marriage the feeling that
if he had anything to say to my father he ought to have said it
then.</p>
<p>And there was yet another cause of which I was quite
unconscious&mdash;that like every other girl before love dawns on
her, half of my nature was still asleep, the half that makes life
lovely and the world dear.</p>
<p>To think that Martin Conrad was the one person who could have
wakened my sleeping heart! That a word, a look, a smile from him
that day could have changed the whole current of my life, and that.
. . .</p>
<p>But no, I will not reproach him. Have I not known since the day
on St. Mary's Rock that above all else he is a born gentleman?</p>
<p>And yet. . . . And yet. . . .</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>MEMORANDUM BY MARTIN CONRAD</h2>
<p>And yet I was a fool, or in spite of everything I should have
spoken to Daniel O'Neill before he left Rome. I should have said to
him:</p>
<p>"Do you know that the man to whom you are going to marry your
daughter is a profligate and a reprobate? If you <i>do</i> know
this, are you deliberately selling her, body and soul, to gratify
your lust of rank and power and all the rest of your rotten
aspirations?"</p>
<p>That is what I ought to have done, but didn't do. I was afraid
of being thought to have personal motives&mdash;of interfering
where I wasn't wanted, of butting in when I had no right.</p>
<p>Yet I felt I <i>had</i> a right, and I had half a mind to throw
up everything and go back to Ellan. But the expedition was the big
chance I had been looking forward to and I could not give it
up.</p>
<p>So I resolved to write. But writing isn't exactly my job, and it
took me a fortnight to get anything done to my satisfaction. By
that time we were at Port Said, and from there I posted three
letters,&mdash;the first to Daniel O'Neill, the second to Bishop
Walsh, the third to Father Dan.</p>
<p>Would they reach in time? If so, would they be read and
considered or resented and destroyed?</p>
<p>I did not know. I could not guess. And then I was going down
into the deep Antarctic night, where no sound from the living world
could reach me.</p>
<p>What would happen before I could get back? Only God could
say.</p>

"TWENTY_FOURTH_CHAPTER"></a>TWENTY-FOURTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding my father's anxiety to leave Rome we travelled
slowly and it was a week before we reached Ellan. By that time my
depression had disappeared, and I was quivering with mingled
curiosity and fear at the thought of meeting the man who was to be
my husband.</p>
<p>My father, for reasons of his own, was equally excited, and as
we sailed into the bay at Blackwater he pointed out the
developments which had been made under his direction&mdash;the
hotels, theatres, dancing palaces and boarding houses that lined
the sea-front, and the electric railways that ran up to the tops of
the mountains.</p>
<p>"See that?" he cried. "I told them I could make this old island
hum."</p>
<p>On a great stone pier that stood deep into the bay, a crowd of
people were waiting for the arrival of the steamer.</p>
<p>"That's nothing," said my father. "Nothing to what you see at
the height of the season."</p>
<p>As soon as we had drawn up alongside the pier, and before the
passengers had landed, four gentlemen came aboard, and my heart
thumped with the thought that my intended husband would be one of
them; but he was not, and the first words spoken to my father
were&mdash;</p>
<p>"His lordship's apologies, sir. He has an engagement to-day, but
hopes to see you at your own house to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>I recognised the speaker as the guardian (grown greyer and even
less prepossessing) who had crossed with the young Lord Raa when he
was going up to Oxford; and his companions were a smooth-faced man
with searching eyes who was introduced as his lordship's solicitor
from London, a Mr. Curphy, whom I knew to be my father's advocate,
and my dear old Father Dan.</p>
<p>I was surprised to find Father Dan a smaller man than I had
thought him, very plain and provincial, a little country parish
priest, but he had the tender smile I always remembered, and the
sweet Irish roll of the vowels that I could never forget.</p>
<p>"God bless you," he said. "How well you're looking! And how like
your mother, Lord rest her soul! I knew the Blessed Virgin would
take care of you, and she has, she has."</p>
<p>Three conveyances were waiting for us&mdash;a grand brougham for
the Bishop, a big motor-car for the guardian and the London lawyer,
and a still bigger one for ourselves.</p>
<p>"Well, s'long until to-morrow then," cried my father, getting up
into the front row of his own ear, with the advocate beside him and
Father Dan and myself behind.</p>
<p>On the way home Father Dan talked of the business that had
brought me back, saying I was not to think too much of anything he
might have said of Lord Raa in his letters, seeing that he had
spoken from hearsay, and the world was so censorious&mdash;and then
there was no measuring the miraculous influence that might be
exercised by a good woman.</p>
<p>He said this with a certain constraint, and was more at ease
when he spoke of the joy that ought to come into a girl's life at
her marriage&mdash;her first love, her first love-letter, her
wedding-day and her first baby, all the sweet and wonderful things
of a new existence which a man could never know.</p>
<p>"Even an old priest may see that," he said, with a laugh and a
pat of my hand.</p>
<p>We dropped Mr. Curphy at his house in Holmtown, and then my
father sat with us at the back, and talked with tremendous energy
of what he had done, of what he was going to do, and of all the
splendours that were before me.</p>
<p>"You'll be the big woman of the island, gel, and there won't be
a mother's son that dare say boo to you."</p>
<p>I noticed that, in his excitement, his tongue, dropping the
suggestion of his adopted country, reverted to the racy speech of
his native soil; and I had a sense of being with him before I was
born, when he returned home from America with millions of dollars
at his back, and the people who had made game of his father went
down before his face like a flood.</p>
<p>Such of them as had not done so then (being of the "aristocracy"
of the island and remembering the humble stock he came from) were
to do so now, for in the second generation, and by means of his
daughter's marriage, he was going to triumph over them all.</p>
<p>"We'll beat 'em, gel! My gough, yes, we'll beat 'em!" he cried,
with a flash of his black eyes and a masterful lift of his
eyebrows.</p>
<p>As we ran by the mansions of the great people of Ellan, he
pointed them out to me with a fling of the arm and spoke of the
families in a tone of contempt.</p>
<p>"See that? That's Christian of Balla-Christian. The man snubbed
me six months ago. He'll know better six months to come. . . .
That's Eyreton. His missus was too big to call on your
mother&mdash;she'll call on you, though, you go bail. See yonder
big tower in the trees? That's Folksdale, where the Farragans live.
The daughters have been walking over the world like peacocks, but
they'll crawl on it like cockroaches. . . . Hulloh, here's ould
Balgean of Eagle Hill, in his grand carriage with his English
coachman. . . . See that, though? See him doff his hat to you, the
ould hypocrite? He knows something. He's got an inkling. Things
travel. We'll beat 'em, gel, we'll beat 'em! They'll be round us
like bees about a honeypot."</p>
<p>It was impossible not to catch the contagion of my father's
triumphant spirits, and in my different way I found myself tingling
with delight as I recognised the scenes associated with my
childhood&mdash;the village, the bridge, the lane to Sunny Lodge
and Murphy's Mouth, and the trees that bordered our drive.</p>
<p>Nearly everything looked smaller or narrower or lower than I had
thought, but I had forgotten how lovely they all were, lying so
snugly under the hill and with the sea in front of them.</p>
<p>Our house alone when we drove up to it seemed larger than I had
expected, but my father explained this by saying:</p>
<p>"Improvements, gel! I'll show you over them to-morrow
morning."</p>
<p>Aunt Bridget (white-headed now and wearing spectacles and a
white cap), Betsy Beauty (grown tall and round, with a kind of
country comeliness) and Nessy MacLeod (looking like a premature old
maid who was doing her best to be a girl) were waiting at the open
porch when our car drew up, and they received me with surprising
cordiality.</p>
<p>"Here she is at last!" said Aunt Bridget.</p>
<p>"And such luck as she has come home to!" said Betsy Beauty.</p>
<p>There were compliments on the improvement in my appearance (Aunt
Bridget declaring she could not have believed it, she really could
not), and then Nessy undertook to take me to my room.</p>
<p>"It's the same room still, Mary," said my Aunt, calling to me as
I went upstairs. "When they were changing everything else I
remembered your poor dear mother and wouldn't hear of their
changing that. It isn't a bit altered."</p>
<p>It was not. Everything was exactly as I remembered it. But just
as I was beginning for the first time in my life to feel grateful
to Aunt Bridget, Nessy said:</p>
<p>"No thanks to her, though. If she'd had her way, she would have
wiped out every trace of your mother, and arranged this marriage
for her own daughter instead."</p>
<p>More of the same kind she said which left me with the impression
that my father was now the god of her idolatry, and that my return
was not too welcome to my aunt and cousin; but as soon as she was
gone, and I was left alone, home began to speak to me in soft and
entrancing whispers.</p>
<p>How my pulses beat, how my nerves tingled! Home! Home! Home!</p>
<p>From that dear spot everything seemed to be the same, and
everything had something to say to me. What sweet and tender and
touching memories!</p>
<p>Here was the big black four-post bed, with the rosary hanging at
its head; and here was the praying-stool with the figure of Our
Lady on the wall above it.</p>
<p>I threw up the window, and there was the salt breath of the sea
in the crisp island air; there was the sea itself glistening in the
afternoon sunshine; there was St Mary's Rock draped in its garment
of sea-weed, and there were the clouds of white sea-gulls whirling
about it.</p>
<p>Taking off my hat and coat I stepped downstairs and out of the
house&mdash;going first into the farm-yard where the spring-less
carts were still clattering over the cobble-stones; then into the
cow-house, where the milkmaids were still sitting on low stools
with their heads against the sides of the slow-eyed Brownies, and
the milk rattling in their noisy pails; then into the farm-kitchen,
where the air was full of the odour of burning turf and the still
sweeter smell of cakes baking on a griddle; and finally into the
potting-shed in the garden, where Tommy the Mate (more than ever
like a weather-beaten old salt) was still working as before.</p>
<p>The old man looked round with his "starboard eye," and
recognised me instantly.</p>
<p>"God bless my sowl," he cried, "if it isn't the lil' missy!
Well, well! Well, well! And she's a woman grown! A real lady too!
My gracious; yes," he said, after a second and longer look, "and
there hasn't been the match of her on this island since they laid
her mother under the sod!"</p>
<p>I wanted to ask him a hundred questions, but Aunt Bridget, who
had been watching from a window, called from the house to say she
was "mashing" a cup of tea for me, so I returned to the
drawing-room where (my father being busy with his letters in the
library) Betsy Beauty talked for half an hour about Lord Raa, his
good looks, distinguished manners and general accomplishments.</p>
<p>"But aren't you just dying to see him?" she said.</p>
<p>I saw him the following morning.</p>

<p>I was sitting in my own room, writing to the Reverend Mother, to
tell her of my return home, when I heard the toot of a horn and
raising my eyes saw a motor-car coming up the drive. It contained
three gentlemen, one of them wore goggles and carried a
silver-haired terrier on his knees.</p>
<p>A little later Nessy MacLeod came to tell me that Lord Raa and
his party had arrived and I was wanted immediately.</p>
<p>I went downstairs hesitatingly, with a haunting sense of coming
trouble. Reaching the door of the drawing-room I saw my intended
husband for the first time&mdash;there being nothing in his
appearance to awaken in me the memory of ever having seen him
before.</p>
<p>He was on the hearthrug in front of the fire, talking to Betsy
Beauty, who was laughing immoderately. To get a better look at him,
and at the same time to compose myself, I stopped for a moment to
speak to the three gentlemen (the two lawyers and Lord Raa's
trustee or guardian) who were standing with my father in the middle
of the floor.</p>
<p>He was undoubtedly well-dressed and had a certain air of
breeding, but even to my girlish eyes he betrayed at that first
sight the character of a man who had lived an irregular, perhaps a
dissipated life.</p>
<p>His face was pale, almost puffy, his grey eyes were slow and
heavy, his moustache was dark and small, his hair was thin over his
forehead, and he had a general appearance of being much older than
his years, which I knew to be thirty-three.</p>
<p>His manners, when I approached him, were courteous and gentle,
almost playful and indulgent, but through all their softness there
pierced a certain hardness, not to say brutality, which I
afterwards learned (when life had had its tug at me) to associate
with a man who has spent much of his time among women of loose
character.</p>
<p>Betsy Beauty made a great matter of introducing us; but in a
drawling voice, and with a certain play of humour, he told her it
was quite unnecessary, since we were very old friends, having made
each other's acquaintance as far back as ten years ago, when I was
the prettiest little woman in the world, he remembered, though
perhaps my manners were not quite cordial.</p>
<p>"We had a slight difference on the subject of kisses. Don't you
remember it?"</p>
<p>Happily there was no necessity to reply, for my father came to
say that he wished to show his lordship the improvements he had
been making, and the rest of us were at liberty to follow them.</p>
<p>The improvements consisted chiefly of a new wing to the old
house, containing a dining room, still unfurnished, which had been
modelled, as I found later, on the corresponding room in Castle
Raa.</p>
<p>With a proud lift of his white head my father pointed out the
beauties of his new possession, while my intended husband, with his
monocle to his eye, looked on with a certain condescension, and
answered with a languid humour that narrowly bordered on
contempt.</p>
<p>"Oak, sir, solid oak," said my father, rapping with his knuckles
on the tall, dark, heavy wainscoting.</p>
<p>"As old as our hearts and as hard as our heads, I suppose," said
Lord Raa.</p>
<p>"Harder than some, sir," said my father.</p>
<p>"Exactly," said Lord Raa in his slow drawl, and then there was
general laughter.</p>
<p>The bell rang for luncheon, and we went into the plain old
dining room, where Aunt Bridget placed her principal guest on her
right and told him all about her late husband, the Colonel, his
honours and military achievements.</p>
<p>I could see that Lord Raa was soon very weary of this, and more
than once, sitting by his side, I caught the cynical and rather
supercilious responses to which, under the gloss of his gracious
manners, Aunt Bridget seemed quite oblivious.</p>
<p>I was so nervous and embarrassed that I spoke very little during
luncheon, and even Aunt Bridget observed this at last.</p>
<p>"Mary, dear, why don't you speak?" she said.</p>
<p>But without waiting for my reply she proceeded to explain to his
lordship that the strangest change had come over me since I was a
child, when I had been the sauciest little chatterbox in the world,
whereas now I was so shy that it was nearly impossible to get a
word out of me.</p>
<p>"Hope I shall be able to get one word out of her, at least,"
said his lordship, whereupon Aunt Bridget smiled significantly and
Betsy Beauty burst into fits of laughter.</p>
<p>Almost before the meal was over, my father rose from his seat at
the head of the table, and indicating the lawyers who sat near to
him, he said:</p>
<p>"These gentlemen and I have business to fix up&mdash;money
matters and all that&mdash;so I guess we'll step into the library
and leave you young people to look after yourselves."</p>
<p>Everybody rose to leave the room.</p>
<p>"All back for tea-time," said Aunt Bridget.</p>
<p>"Of course you don't want <i>me</i>," said Betsy Beauty with a
giggle, and at the next moment I was alone with his lordship, who
drew a long breath that was almost like a yawn, and said:</p>
<p>"Is there no quiet place we can slip away to?"</p>
<p>There was the glen at the back of the house (the Cape Flora of
Martin Conrad), so I took him into that, not without an increasing
sense of embarrassment. It was a clear October day, the glen was
dry, and the air under the shadow of the thinning trees was full of
the soft light of the late autumn.</p>
<p>"Ah, this is better," said his lordship.</p>
<p>He lit a cigar and walked for some time by my side without
speaking, merely flicking the seeding heads off the dying thistles
with his walking stick, and then ruckling it through the withered
leaves with which the path was strewn.</p>
<p>But half way up the glen he began to look aslant at me through
his monocle, and then to talk about my life in Rome, wondering how
I could have been content to stay so long at the Convent, and
hinting at a rumour which had reached him that I had actually
wished to stay there altogether.</p>
<p>"Extraordinary! 'Pon my word, extraordinary! It's well enough
for women who have suffered shipwreck in their lives to live in
such places, but for a young gal with any fortune, any looks . . .
why I wonder she doesn't die of <i>ennui</i>."</p>
<p>I was still too nervous and embarrassed to make much protest, so
he went on to tell me with what difficulty he supported the boredom
of his own life even in London, with its clubs, its race-meetings,
its dances, its theatres and music halls, and the amusement to be
got out of some of the ladies of society, not to speak of certain
well-known professional beauties.</p>
<p>One of his great friends&mdash;his name was Eastcliff&mdash;was
going to marry the most famous of the latter class (a foreign
dancer at the "Empire"), and since he was rich and could afford to
please himself, why shouldn't he?</p>
<p>When we reached the waterfall at the top of the glen (it had
been the North Cape of Martin Conrad), we sat on a rustic seat
which stands there, and then, to my still deeper embarrassment, his
lordship's conversation came to close quarters.</p>
<p>Throwing away his cigar and taking his silver-haired terrier on
his lap he said:</p>
<p>"Of course you know what the business is which the gentlemen are
discussing in the library?"</p>
<p>As well as I could for the nervousness that was stifling me, I
answered that I knew.</p>
<p>He stroked the dog with one hand, prodded his stick into the
gravel with the other, and said:</p>
<p>"Well, I don't know what your views about marriage are. Mine, I
may say, are liberal."</p>
<p>I listened without attempting to reply.</p>
<p>"I think nine-tenths of the trouble that attends married
life&mdash;the breakdowns and what not&mdash;come of an irrational
effort to tighten the marriage knot."</p>
<p>Still I said nothing.</p>
<p>"To imagine that two independent human beings can be tied
together like a couple of Siamese twins, neither to move without
the other, living precisely the same life, year in, year out . . .
why, it's silly, positively silly."</p>
<p>In my ignorance I could find nothing to say, and after another
moment my intended husband swished the loosened gravel with his
stick and said:</p>
<p>"I believe in married people leaving each other free&mdash;each
going his and her own way&mdash;what do you think?"</p>
<p>I must have stammered some kind of answer&mdash;I don't know
what&mdash;for I remember that he said next:</p>
<p>"Quite so, that's my view of matrimony, and I'm glad to see you
appear to share it. . . . Tell the truth, I was afraid you
wouldn't," he added, with something more about the nuns and the
convent.</p>
<p>I wanted to say that I didn't, but my nervousness was increasing
every moment, and before I could find words in which to protest he
was speaking to me again.</p>
<p>"Our friends in the library seem to think that you and I could
get along together, and I'm disposed to think they're
right&mdash;aren't you?"</p>
<p>In my ignorance and helplessness, and with the consciousness of
what I was expected to do, I merely looked at him without
speaking.</p>
<p>Then he fixed his monocle afresh, and, looking back at me in a
curious way, he said:</p>
<p>"I don't think I should bore you, my dear. In fact, I should be
rather proud of having a good-looking woman for my wife, and I
fancy I could give you a good time. In any case"&mdash;this with a
certain condescension&mdash;"my <i>name</i> might be of some use to
you."</p>
<p>A sort of shame was creeping over me. The dog was yawning in my
face. My intended husband threw it off his knee.</p>
<p>"Shall we consider it a settled thing, then?" he asked, and when
in my confusion I still made no reply (having nothing which I felt
myself entitled to say), he said something about Aunt Bridget and
what she had told him at luncheon about my silence and shyness, and
then rising to his feet he put my arm through his own, and turned
our faces towards home.</p>
<p>That was all. As I am a truthful woman, that was everything. Not
a word from me, nay, not half a word, merely a passive act of
silent acquiescence, and in my youthful and almost criminal
innocence I was committed to the most momentous incident of my
life.</p>
<p>But if there was no love-making, no fondling, no kissing, no
courtship of any kind, and none of the delirious rapture which used
to be described in Alma's novels, I was really grateful for that,
and immensely relieved to find that matters could he completed
without them.</p>
<p>When we reached the house, the bell was ringing for tea and my
father was coming out of the library, followed by the lawyers.</p>
<p>"So that's all right, gentlemen?" he was saying.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's all right, sir," they were answering; and then,
seeing us as we entered, my father said to Lord Raa:</p>
<p>"And what about you two?"</p>
<p>"We're all right also," said his lordship in his drawling
voice.</p>
<p>"Good!" said my father, and he slapped his lordship sharply on
the back, to his surprise, and I think, discomfiture.</p>
<p>Then with a cackle of light laughter among the men, we all
trooped into the drawing room.</p>
<p>Aunt Bridget in her gold-rimmed spectacles and new white cap,
poured out the tea from our best silver tea-pot, while Nessy
MacLeod with a geranium in her red hair, and Betsy Beauty, with
large red roses in her bosom, handed round the cups. After a
moment, my father, with a radiant face, standing back to the fire,
said in a loud voice:</p>
<p>"Friends all, I have something to tell you."</p>
<p>Everybody except myself looked up and listened, though everybody
knew what was coming.</p>
<p>"We've had a stiff tussle in the library this afternoon, but
everything is settled satisfactory&mdash;and the marriage is as
good as made."</p>
<p>There was a chorus of congratulations for me, and a few for his
lordship, and then my father said again:</p>
<p>"Of course there'll be deeds to draw up, and I want things done
correct, even if it costs me a bit of money. But we've only one
thing more to fix up to-day, and then we're through&mdash;the
wedding. When is it to come off?"</p>
<p>An appeal was made to me, but I felt it was only formal, so I
glanced across to Lord Raa without speaking.</p>
<p>"Come now," said my father, looking from one to the other. "The
clean cut is the short cut, you know, and when I'm sot on doing a
thing, I can't take rest till it's done. What do you say to this
day next month?"</p>
<p>I bowed and my intended husband, in his languid way, said:</p>
<p>"Agreed!"</p>
<p>A few minutes afterwards the motor was ordered round, and the
gentlemen prepared to go. Then the silver-haired terrier was
missed, and for the first time that day his lordship betrayed a
vivid interest, telling us its price and pedigree and how much he
would give rather than lose it. But at the last moment Tommy
appeared with the dog in his arms and dropped it into the car,
whereupon my intended husband thanked him effusively.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Tommy, "I thought you set store by <i>that</i>,
sir."</p>
<p>At the next moment the car was gone.</p>
<p>"Well, you <i>are</i> a lucky girl," said Betsy Beauty; and Aunt
Bridget began to take credit to herself for all that had come to
pass, and to indicate the methods by which she meant to manage
Castle Raa as soon as ever I became mistress of it.</p>
<p>Thus in my youth, my helplessness, my ignorance, and my
inexperience I became engaged to the man who had been found and
courted for me. If I acquiesced, I had certainly not been
consulted. My father had not consulted me. My intended husband had
not consulted me. Nobody consulted me. I am not even sure that I
thought anybody was under any obligation to consult me. Love had
not spoken to me, sex was still asleep in me, and my marriage was
arranged before my deeper nature knew what was being done.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="TWENTY_SIXTH_CHAPTER" id=
"TWENTY_SIXTH_CHAPTER"></a>TWENTY-SIXTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>The next weeks were full of hurry, hubbub and perturbation. Our
house was turned upside down. Milliners, sewing-maids and
dressmakers were working day and night. Flowers, feathers and silk
remnants were flowing like sea-wrack into every room. Orders were
given, orders were retracted and given again, and then again
retracted.</p>
<p>Such flying up and down stairs! Everybody so breathless!
Everybody so happy! Every face wearing a smile! Every tongue
rippling with laughter! The big grey mansion which used to seem so
chill and cold felt for the first time like a house of joy.</p>
<p>In the midst of these busy preparations I had no time to think.
My senses were excited. I was dazed, stunned, wrapped round by a
kind of warm air of hot-house happiness, and this condition of
moral intoxication increased as the passing of the days brought
fresh developments.</p>
<p>Our neighbours began to visit us. My father had been right about
the great people of the island. Though they had stood off so long,
they found their account in my good fortune, and as soon as my
marriage was announced they came in troops to offer their
congratulations.</p>
<p>Never, according to Tommy the Mate, had the gravel of our
carriage drive been so rucked up by the pawing feet of high-bred
horses. But their owners were no less restless. It was almost
pitiful to see their shamefacedness as they entered our house for
the first time, and to watch the shifts they were put to in order
to account for the fact that they had never been there before.</p>
<p>Aunt Bridget's vanity was too much uplifted by their presence to
be particular about their excuses, but my father's contempt of
their subterfuges was naked and undisguised, and I hardly know
whether to feel amused or ashamed when I think of how he scored off
them, how he lashed them to the bone, with what irony and sarcasm
he scorched their time-serving little souls.</p>
<p>When they were very great folks, the "aristocracy" of Ellan, he
pretended not to know who they were, and asked their names, their
father's names, and what parishes they came from.</p>
<p>"Some of the Christians of Balla-Christian, are you? Think of
that now. And me a born Ellanman, and not knowing you from
Adam!"</p>
<p>When they were very near neighbours, with lands that made
boundary with our own, he pretended to think they had been twenty
years abroad, or perhaps sick, or even dead and buried.</p>
<p>"Too bad, ma'am, too bad," he would say. "And me thinking you
were under the sod through all the lonely years my poor wife was
ill and dying."</p>
<p>But when they were insular officials, who "walked on the stars,"
and sometimes snubbed him in public, the rapier of ridicule was too
light for his heavy hand, and he took up the sledge-hammer, telling
them he was the same man to-day as yesterday, and only his
circumstances were different&mdash;his daughter being about to
become the lady of the first house in the island, and none of them
being big enough to be left out of it.</p>
<p>After such scenes Aunt Bridget, for all her despotism within her
own doors, used to tremble with dread of our neighbours taking
lasting offence, but my father would say:</p>
<p>"Chut, woman, they'll come again, and make no more faces about
it."</p>
<p>They did, and if they were shy of my father they were gracious
enough to me, saying it was such a good thing for society in the
island that Castle Raa was to have a lady, a real lady, at the head
of it at last.</p>
<p>Then came their wedding presents&mdash;pictures, books, silver
ornaments, gold ornaments, clocks, watches, chains, jewellery,
until my bedroom was blocked up with them. As each fresh parcel
arrived there would be a rush of all the female members of our
household to open it, after which Betsy Beauty would say:</p>
<p>"What a lucky girl you are!"</p>
<p>I began to think I was. I found it impossible to remain
unaffected by the whirlwind of joyous turmoil in which I lived. The
refulgence of the present hour wiped out the past, which seemed to
fade away altogether. After the first few days I was flying about
from place to place, and wherever I went I was a subject for
congratulation and envy.</p>
<p>If there were moments of misgiving, when, like the cold wind out
of a tunnel, there came the memory of the Reverend Mother and the
story she had told me at Nemi, there were other moments when I felt
quite sure that, in marrying Lord Raa, I should be doing a
self-sacrificing thing and a kind of solemn duty.</p>
<p>One such moment was when Mr. Curphy, my father's advocate, who
with his clammy hands always made me think of an over-fatted fish,
came to tell him that, after serious legal difficulties, the civil
documents had been agreed to, for, after he had finished with my
father, he drew me aside and said, as he smoothed his long brown
beard:</p>
<p>"You ought to be a happy girl, Mary. I suppose you know what you
are doing for your father? You are wiping out the greatest
disappointment of his life, and rectifying the cruelty&mdash;the
inevitable cruelty&mdash;of the law, when you were born a daughter
after he had expected a son."</p>
<p>Another such moment was when the Bishop came, in his grand
carriage, to say that after much discussion he had persuaded his
lordship to sign the necessary declaration that all the children of
our union, irrespective of sex, should be brought up as Catholics,
for taking me aside, as the advocate had done the day before, he
said, in his suave voice, fingering his jewelled cross:</p>
<p>"I congratulate you, my child. Yours is a great and precious
privilege&mdash;the privilege of bringing back to the Church a
family which has been estranged from it for nineteen years."</p>
<p>At the end of a fortnight we signed the marriage settlement. The
little ceremony took place in the drawing-room of my father's
house. My intended husband, who had not been to see me in the
meantime, brought with him (as well as his trustee and lawyer) a
lady and a gentleman.</p>
<p>The lady was his maiden aunt, Lady Margaret Anslem, a fair woman
of about forty, fashionably dressed, redolent of perfume, and
(except to me, to whom she talked quite amicably) rather reserved
and haughty, as if the marriage of her nephew into our family were
a bitter pill which she had compelled herself to swallow.</p>
<p>The gentleman was a tall young man wearing a very high collar
and cravat, and using a handkerchief with embroidered initials in
the corner of it. He turned out to be the Hon. Edward
Eastcliff&mdash;the great friend who, being rich enough to please
himself, was about to marry the professional beauty.</p>
<p>I noticed that Aunt Bridget, with something of the instinct of
the fly about the flame, immediately fixed herself upon the one,
and that Betsy Beauty attached herself to the other.</p>
<p>Lord Raa himself looked as tired as before, and for the first
half-hour he behaved as if he did not quite know what to do with
himself for wretchedness and <i>ennui</i>.</p>
<p>Then the deeds were opened and spread out on a table, and though
the gentlemen seemed to be trying not to discuss the contents aloud
I could not help hearing some of the arrangements that had been
made for the payment of my intended husband's debts, and certain
details of his annual allowance.</p>
<p>Looking back upon that ugly hour, I wonder why, under the
circumstances, I should have been so wounded, but I remember that a
sense of discomfort amounting to shame came upon me at sight of the
sorry bargaining. It seemed to have so little to do with the
spiritual union of souls, which I had been taught to think marriage
should be. But I had no time to think more about that before my
father, who had signed the documents himself in his large, heavy
hand, was saying.</p>
<p>"Now, gel, come along, we're waiting for your signature."</p>
<p>I cannot remember that I read anything. I cannot remember that
anything was read to me. I was told where to sign, and I signed,
thinking what must be must be, and that was all I had to do with
the matter.</p>
<p>I was feeling a little sick, nevertheless, and standing by the
tire with one foot on the fender, when Lord Raa came up to me at
the end, and said in his drawling voice:</p>
<p>"So it's done."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's done," I answered.</p>
<p>After a moment he talked of where we were to live, saying we
must of course pass most of our time in London.</p>
<p>"But have you any choice about the honeymoon," he said, "where
we should spend it, I mean?"</p>
<p>I answered that he would know best, but when he insisted on my
choosing, saying it was my right to do so, I remembered that during
my time in the Convent the one country in the world I had most
desired to see was the Holy Land.</p>
<p>Never as long as I live shall I forget the look in his
lordship's grey eyes when I gave this as my selection.</p>
<p>"You mean Jerusalem&mdash;Nazareth&mdash;the Dead Sea and all
that?" he asked.</p>
<p>I felt my face growing red as at a frightful <i>faux pas</i>,
but his lordship only laughed, called me his "little nun," and said
that since I had been willing to leave the choice to him he would
suggest Egypt and Italy, and Berlin and Paris on the way back, with
the condition that we left Ellan for London on the day of our
marriage.</p>
<p>After the party from Castle Raa had gone, leaving some of their
family lace and pearls behind for the bride to wear at her wedding,
and after Aunt Bridget had hoped that "that woman" (meaning Lady
Margaret) didn't intend to live at the Castle after my marriage,
because such a thing would not fit in with her plans "at all, at
all," I mentioned the arrangements for the honeymoon, whereupon
Betsy Beauty, to whom Italy was paradise, and London glimmered in
an atmosphere of vermillion and gold, cried out as usual:</p>
<p>"What a lucky, lucky girl you are!"</p>
<p>But the excitement which had hitherto buoyed me up was partly
dispelled by this time, and I was beginning to feel some doubt of
it.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="TWENTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"TWENTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER"></a>TWENTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>As my wedding-day approached and time ran short, the air of joy
which had pervaded our house was driven out by an atmosphere of
irritation. We were all living on our nerves. The smiles that used
to be at everybody's service gave place to frowns, and, in Aunt
Bridget's case, to angry words which were distributed on all sides
and on all occasions.</p>
<p>As a consequence I took refuge in my room, and sat long hours
there in my dressing-gown and slippers, hearing the hubbub that was
going on in the rest of the house, but taking as little part in it
as possible. In this semi-conventual silence and solitude, the
excitement which had swept me along for three weeks subsided
rapidly.</p>
<p>I began to think, and above all to feel, and the one thing I
felt beyond everything else was a sense of something wanting.</p>
<p>I remembered the beautiful words of the Pope about marriage as a
mystic relation, a sacred union of souls, a bond of love such as
Christ's love for His Church, and I asked myself if I felt any such
love for the man who was to become my husband.</p>
<p>I knew I did not. I reminded myself that I had had nearly no
conversation with him, that our intercourse had been of the
briefest, that I had seen him only three times altogether, and that
I scarcely knew him at all.</p>
<p>And yet I was going to marry him! In a few days more I should be
his wife, and we should be bound together as long as life should
last!</p>
<p>Then I remembered what Father Dan had said about a girl's first
love, her first love-letter, and all the sweet, good things that
should come to her at the time of her marriage.</p>
<p>None of them had come to me. I do not think my thoughts of love
were ever disturbed by any expectation of the delights of the
heart&mdash;languors of tenderness, long embraces, sighs and
kisses, and the joys and fevers of the flesh&mdash;for I knew
nothing about them. But, nevertheless, I asked myself if I had
mistaken the matter altogether. Was love really necessary? In all
their busy preparations neither my father, nor my husband, nor the
lawyers, nor the Bishop himself, had said anything about that.</p>
<p>I began to sleep badly and to dream. It was always the same
dream. I was in a frozen region of the far north or south, living
in a ship which was stuck fast in the ice, and had a great frowning
barrier before it that was full of dangerous crevasses. Then for
some reason I wanted to write a letter, but was unable to do so,
because somebody had trodden on my pen and broken it.</p>
<p>It seems strange to me now as I look back upon that time, that I
did not know what angel was troubling the waters of my
soul&mdash;that Nature was whispering to me, as it whispers to
every girl at the first great crisis of her life. But neither did I
know what angel was leading my footsteps when, three mornings
before my wedding-day, I got up early and went out to walk in the
crisp salt air.</p>
<p>Almost without thinking I turned down the lane that led to the
shore, and before I was conscious of where I was going, I found
myself near Sunny Lodge. The chimney was smoking for breakfast, and
there was a smell of burning turf coming from the house, which was
so pretty and unchanged, with the last of the year's roses creeping
over the porch and round the windows of the room in which I had
slept when a child.</p>
<p>Somebody was digging in the garden. It was the doctor in his
shirt sleeves.</p>
<p>"Good morning, doctor," I called, speaking over the fence.</p>
<p>He rested on his spade and looked up, but did not speak for a
moment.</p>
<p>"Don't you know who I am?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Why yes, of course; you must be. . . ."</p>
<p>Without finishing he turned his head towards the porch and
cried:</p>
<p>"Mother! Mother! Come and see who's here at last!"</p>
<p>Martin's mother came out of the porch, a little smaller, I
thought, but with the same dear womanly face over her light print
frock, which was as sweet as may-blossom.</p>
<p>She held up both hands at sight of me and cried:</p>
<p>"There, now! What did I tell you, doctor! Didn't I say they
might marry her to fifty lords, but she wouldn't forget her old
friends!"</p>
<p>I laughed, the doctor laughed, and then she laughed, and the
sweetest part of it was that she did not know what we were laughing
at.</p>
<p>Then I opened the gate and stepped up and held out my hand, and
involuntarily she wiped her own hand (which was covered with meal
from the porridge she was making) before taking mine.</p>
<p>"Goodness me, it's Mary O'Neill."</p>
<p>"Yes, it's I."</p>
<p>"But let me have a right look at you," she said, taking me now
by both hands. "They were saying such wonderful things about the
young misthress that I wasn't willing to believe them. But, no,
no," she said, after a moment, "they didn't tell me the half."</p>
<p>I was still laughing, but it was as much as I could do not to
cry, so I said:</p>
<p>"May I come in?"</p>
<p>"My goodness yes, and welcome," she said, and calling to the
doctor to wash his hands and follow us, she led the way into the
kitchen-parlour, where the kettle was singing from the "slowery"
and a porridge-pot was bubbling over the fire.</p>
<p>"Sit down. Take the elbow-chair in the chiollagh [the hearth
place]. There! That's nice. Aw, yes, you know the house."</p>
<p>Being by this time unable to speak for a lump in my throat that
was hurting me, I looked round the room, so sweet, so homely, so
closely linked with tender memories of my childhood, while Martin's
mother (herself a little nervous and with a touching softness in
her face) went on talking while she stirred the porridge with a
porridge-stick.</p>
<p>"Well, well! To think of all the years since you came singing
carols to my door! You remember it, don't you? . . . Of course you
do. 'Doctor,' I said, 'don't talk foolish. <i>She'll</i> not
forget. <i>I</i> know Mary O'Neill. She may be going to be a great
lady, but haven't I nursed her on my knee?'"</p>
<p>"Then you've heard what's to happen?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Aw yes, woman, yes," she answered in a sadder tone, I thought.
"Everybody's bound to hear it&mdash;what with the bands practising
for the procession, and the bullocks roasting for the poor, and the
fireworks and the illuminations, and I don't know what."</p>
<p>She was silent for a moment after that, and then in her simple
way she said:</p>
<p>"But it's all as one if you love the man, even if he <i>is</i> a
lord."</p>
<p>"You think that's necessary, don't you?"</p>
<p>"What, <i>millish?</i>"</p>
<p>"Love. You think it's necessary to love one's husband?"</p>
<p>"Goodness sakes, girl, yes. If you don't have love, what have
you? What's to keep the pot boiling when the fire's getting low and
the winter's coming on, maybe? The doctor's telling me some of the
fine ladies in London are marrying without it&mdash;just for money
and titles and all to that. But I can't believe it, I really can't!
They've got their troubles same as ourselves, poor things, and
what's the use of their fine clothes and grand carriages when the
dark days come and the night's falling on them?"</p>
<p>It was harder than ever to speak now, so I got up to look at
some silver cups that stood on the mantelpiece.</p>
<p>"Martin's," said his mother, to whom they were precious as
rubies. "He won them at swimming and running and leaping and
climbing and all to that. Aw, yes, yes! He was always grand at
games, if he couldn't learn his lessons, poor boy. And now he's
gone away from us&mdash;looking for South Poles somewheres."</p>
<p>"I know&mdash;I saw him in Rome," said I.</p>
<p>She dropped her porridge-stick and looked at me with big
eyes.</p>
<p>"Saw him? In Rome, you say? After he sailed, you mean?"</p>
<p>I nodded, and then she cried excitedly to the doctor who was
just then coming into the house, after washing his hands under the
pump.</p>
<p>"Father, she saw himself in Rome after he sailed."</p>
<p>There was only one <i>himself</i> in that house, therefore it
was not difficult for the doctor to know who was meant. And so
great was the eagerness of the old people to hear the last news of
the son who was the apple of their eye that I had to stay to
breakfast and tell them all about our meeting.</p>
<p>While Martin's mother laid the tables with oat-cake and honey
and bowls of milk and deep plates for the porridge, I told the
little there was to tell, and then listened to their simple
comments.</p>
<p>"There now, doctor! Think of that! Those two meeting in foreign
parts that used to be such friends when they were children! Like
brother and sister, you might say. And whiles and whiles we were
thinking that some day . . . but we'll say no more about that now,
doctor."</p>
<p>"No, we'll say no more about that now, Christian Ann," said the
doctor.</p>
<p>Then there was a moment of silence, and it was just as if they
had been rummaging among half-forgotten things in a dark corner of
their house, and had come upon a cradle, and the child that had
lived in it was dead.</p>
<p>It was sweet, but it was also painful to stay long in that house
of love, and as soon as I had eaten my oat-cake and honey I got up
to go. The two good souls saw me to the door saying I was not to
expect either of them at the Big House on my wedding-day, because
she was no woman for smart clothes, and the doctor, who was growing
rheumatic, had given up his night-calls, and therefore his gig, so
as to keep down expenses.</p>
<p>"We'll be at the church, though," said Martin's mother. "And if
we don't see you to speak to, you'll know we're there and wishing
you happiness in our hearts."</p>
<p>I could not utter a word when I left them; but after I had
walked a little way I looked back, intending to wave my farewell,
and there they were together at the gate still, and one of her
hands was on the doctor's shoulder&mdash;the sweet woman who had
chosen love against the world, and did not regret it, even now when
the night was falling on her.</p>
<p>I had to pass the Presbytery on my way home, and as I did so, I
saw Father Dan in his study. He threw up the window sash and called
in a soft voice, asking me to wait until he came down to me.</p>
<p>He came down hurriedly, just as he was, in his worn and
discoloured cassock and biretta, and walked up the road by my side,
breathing rapidly and obviously much agitated.</p>
<p>"The Bishop is staying with me over the wedding, and he is in
such a fury that . . . Don't worry. It will be all right. But . .
."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Did you see young Martin Conrad while you were in Rome?"</p>
<p>I answered that I did.</p>
<p>"And did anything pass between you . . . about your marriage, I
mean?"</p>
<p>I told him all that I had said to Martin, and all that Martin
had said to me.</p>
<p>"Because he has written a long letter to the Bishop denouncing
it, and calling on him to stop it."</p>
<p>"To stop it?"</p>
<p>"That's so. He says it is nothing but trade and barter, and if
the Church is willing to give its blessing to such rank
commercialism, let it bless the Stock Exchange, let it sanctify the
slave market."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"The Bishop threatens to tell your father. 'Who is this young
man,' he says, 'who dares to . . .' But if I thought there was
nothing more to your marriage than . . . If I imagined that what
occurred in the case of your dear mother . . . But that's not
all."</p>
<p>"Not all?"</p>
<p>"No. Martin has written to me too, saying worse&mdash;far
worse."</p>
<p>"What does he say, Father Dan?"</p>
<p>"I don't really know if I ought to tell you, I really don't. Yet
if it's true . . . if there's anything in it . . ."</p>
<p>I was trembling, but I begged him to tell me what Martin had
said. He told me. It was about my intended husband&mdash;that he
was a man of irregular life, a notorious loose liver, who kept up a
connection with somebody in London, a kind of actress who was
practically his wife already, and therefore his marriage with me
would be&mdash;so Martin had said&mdash;nothing but "legalised and
sanctified concubinage."</p>
<p>With many breaks and pauses my dear old priest told me this
story, as if it were something so infamous that his simple and
innocent heart could scarcely credit it.</p>
<p>"If I really thought it was true," he said, "that a man living
such a life could come here to marry my little . . . But no, God
could not suffer a thing like that. I must ask, though. I must make
sure. We live so far away in this little island that . . . But I
must go back now. The Bishop will be calling for me."</p>
<p>Still deeply agitated, Father Dan left me by the bridge, and at
the gate of our drive I found Tommy the Mate on a ladder, covering,
with flowers from the conservatory, a triumphal arch which the
joiner had hammered up the day before.</p>
<p>The old man hardly noticed me as I passed through, and this
prompted me to look up and speak to him.</p>
<p>"Tommy," I said, "do you know you are the only one who hasn't
said a good word to me about my marriage?"</p>
<p>"Am I, missy?" he answered, without looking down. "Then maybe
that's because I've had so many bad ones to say to other
people."</p>
<p>I asked which other people.</p>
<p>"Old Johnny Christopher, for one. I met him last night at the
'Horse and Saddle.' 'Grand doings at the Big House, they're telling
me,' says Johnny. 'I won't say no,' I says. 'It'll be a proud day
for the grand-daughter of Neill the Lord when she's mistress of
Castle Raa,' says Johnny. 'Maybe so,' I says, 'but it'll be a
prouder day for Castle Raa when she sets her clane little foot in
it.'"</p>

<h2><a name="TWENTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER" id=
"TWENTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER"></a>TWENTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I should find it difficult now, after all that has happened
since, to convey an adequate idea of the sense of shame and
personal dishonour which was produced in me by Father Dan's account
of the contents of Martin's letter. It was like opening a door out
of a beautiful garden into a stagnant ditch.</p>
<p>That Martin's story was true I had never one moment's doubt,
first because Martin had told it, and next because it agreed at all
points with the little I had learned of Lord Raa in the only real
conversation I had yet had with him.</p>
<p>Obviously he cared for the other woman, and if, like his friend
Eastcliff, he had been rich enough to please himself, he would have
married her; but being in debt, and therefore in need of an
allowance, he was marrying me in return for my father's money.</p>
<p>It was shocking. It was sinful. I could not believe that my
father, the lawyers and the Bishop knew anything about it.</p>
<p>I determined to tell them, but how to do so, being what I was, a
young girl out of a convent, I did not know.</p>
<p>Never before had I felt so deeply the need of my mother. If she
had been alive I should have gone to her, and with my arms about
her neck and my face in her breast, I should have told her all my
trouble.</p>
<p>There was nobody but Aunt Bridget, and little as I had ever
expected to go to her under any circumstances, with many misgivings
and after much hesitation I went.</p>
<p>It was the morning before the day of my marriage. I followed my
aunt as she passed through the house like a biting March wind,
scolding everybody, until I found her in her own room.</p>
<p>She was ironing her new white cap, and as I entered (looking
pale, I suppose) she flopped down her flat iron on to its stand and
cried:</p>
<p>"Goodness me, girl, what's amiss? Caught a cold with your
morning walks, eh? Haven't I enough on my hands without that? We
must send for the doctor straight. We can't have <i>you</i> laid up
now, after all this trouble and expense."</p>
<p>"It isn't that, Auntie."</p>
<p>"Then in the name of goodness what is it?"</p>
<p>I told her, as well as I could for the cold grey eyes that kept
looking at me through their gold-rimmed spectacles. At first my
aunt listened with amazement, and then she laughed outright.</p>
<p>"So <i>you've</i> heard that story, have you? Mary O'Neill," she
said, with a thump of her flat iron, "I'm surprised at you."</p>
<p>I asked if she thought it wasn't true.</p>
<p>"How do I know if it's true? And what do I care whether it is or
isn't? Young men will be young men, I suppose."</p>
<p>She went on with her ironing as she added:</p>
<p>"Did you expect you were marrying a virgin? If every woman asked
for that there would be a nice lot of old maids in the world,
wouldn't there?"</p>
<p>I felt myself flushing up to the forehead, yet I managed to
say:</p>
<p>"But if he is practically married to the other woman. . . ."</p>
<p>"Not he married. Whoever thinks about marriage in company like
that? You might as well talk about marriage in the hen coop."</p>
<p>"But all the same if he cares for her, Auntie. . . ."</p>
<p>"Who says he cares for her? And if he does he'll settle her off
and get rid of her before he marries you."</p>
<p>"But will that be right?" I said, whereupon my aunt rested her
iron and looked at me as if I had said something shameful.</p>
<p>"Mary O'Neill, what do you mean? Of course it will be right. He
shouldn't have two women, should he? Do you think the man's a
barn-door rooster?"</p>
<p>My confusion was increasing, but I said that in any case my
intended husband could not care for <i>me</i>, or he would have
seen more of me.</p>
<p>"Oh, you'll see enough of him by and by. Don't you worry about
that."</p>
<p>I said I was not sure that he had made me care much for him.</p>
<p>"Time enough for that, too. You can't expect the man to work
miracles."</p>
<p>Then, with what courage was left me, I tried to say that I had
been taught to think of marriage as a sacrament, instituted by the
Almighty so that those who entered it might live together in union,
peace and love, whereas . . .</p>
<p>But I had to stop, for Aunt Bridget, who had been looking at me
with her hard lip curled, said:</p>
<p>"Tut! That's all right to go to church with on Sunday, but on
weekdays marriage is no moonshine, I can tell you. It's a practical
matter. Just an arrangement for making a home, and getting a
family, and bringing up children&mdash;that's what marriage is, if
you ask me."</p>
<p>"But don't you think love is necessary?"</p>
<p>"Depends what you mean by love. If you mean what they talk about
in poetry and songs&mdash;bleeding hearts and sighs and kisses and
all that nonsense&mdash;no!" said my aunt, with a heavy bang on her
ironing.</p>
<p>"That's what people mean when they talk about marrying for love,
and it generally ends in poverty and misery, and sensible women
have nothing to do with it. Look at me," she said, spitting on the
bottom of her iron, "do you think I married for love when I married
the colonel? No indeed! 'Here's a quiet respectable man with a nice
income,' I said, 'and if I put my little bit to his little bit
we'll get along comfortably if he <i>is</i> a taste in years,' I
said. Look at your mother, though. She was one of the
marrying-for-love kind, and if we had let her have her way where
would she have been afterwards with her fifteen years as an
invalid? And where would you have been by this time? No," said Aunt
Bridget, bringing down her flat-iron with a still heavier bang, "a
common-sense marriage, founded on suitability of position and
property, and all that, is the only proper sort of match. And
that's what's before you now, girl, so for goodness' sake don't go
about like the parish pan, letting every busybody make mischief
with you. My Betsy wouldn't if she had your chance&mdash;I can tell
you that much, my lady."</p>
<p>I did not speak. There was another bang or two of the flat-iron,
and then,</p>
<p>"Besides, love will come. Of course it will. It will come in
time. If you don't exactly love your husband when you marry him
you'll love him later on. A wife ought to teach herself to love her
husband. I know I had to, and if. . . ."</p>
<p>"But if she can't, Auntie?"</p>
<p>"Then she ought to be ashamed of herself, and say nothing about
it."</p>
<p>It was useless to say more, so I rose to go.</p>
<p>"Yes, go," said Aunt Bridget. "I'm so bothered with other
people's business that my head's all through-others. And, Mary
O'Neill," she said, looking after me as I passed through the door,
"for mercy's sake do brighten up a hit, and don't look as if
marrying a husband was like taking a dose of jalap. It isn't as bad
as that, anyway."</p>
<p>It served me right. I should have known better. My aunt and I
spoke different languages; we stood on different ground.</p>
<p>Returning to my room I found a letter from Father Dan. It
ran&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Dear Daughter in Jesus</i>,</p>
<p>"<i>I have been afraid to go far into the story we spoke about
from fear of offending my Bishop, but I have inquired of your
father and he assures me that there is not a word of truth in
it</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>So I am compelled to believe that our good Martin must have
been misinformed, and am dismissing the matter from my mind.
Trusting you will dismiss it from your mind also</i>,</p>
<p>"<i>Yours in Xt.</i>,</p>
<p>"<i>D.D.</i>"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="TWENTY_NINTH_CHAPTER" id=
"TWENTY_NINTH_CHAPTER"></a>TWENTY-NINTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I could not do as Father Dan advised, being now enmeshed in the
threads of innumerable impulses unknown to myself, and therefore
firmly convinced that Martin's story was not only true, but a part
of the whole sordid business whereby a husband was being bought for
me.</p>
<p>With this thought I went about all day, asking myself what I
could do even yet, but finding no answer until nine o'clock at
night, when, immediately after supper (we lived country fashion),
Aunt Bridget said:</p>
<p>"Now then, off to bed, girls. Everybody must be stirring early
in the morning."</p>
<p>And then I slipped upstairs to my room, and replied to Father
Dan.</p>
<p>Never had I written such a letter before. I poured my whole
heart on to the paper, saying what marriage meant to me, as the
Pope himself had explained it, a sacrament implying and requiring
love as the very soul of it, and since I did not feel this love for
the man I was about to marry, and had no grounds for thinking he
felt it for me, and being sure that other reasons had operated to
bring us together, I begged Father Dan, by his memory of my mother,
and his affection for me, and his desire to see me good and happy,
to intervene with my father and the Bishop, even at this late hour,
and at the church door itself to stop the ceremony.</p>
<p>It was late before I finished, and I thought the household was
asleep, but just as I was coming to an end I heard my father moving
in the room below, and then a sudden impulse came to me, and with a
new thought I went downstairs and knocked at his door.</p>
<p>"Who's there?" he cried. "Come in."</p>
<p>He was sitting in his shirt sleeves, shaving before a
looking-glass which was propped up against two ledgers. The lather
on his upper lip gave his face a fierce if rather grotesque
expression.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's you," he said. "Sit down. Got to do this
to-night&mdash;goodness knows if I'll have time for it in the
morning."</p>
<p>I took the seat in the ingle which Father Dan occupied on the
night of my birth. The fire had nearly burnt out.</p>
<p>"Thought you were in bed by this time. Guess I should have been
in bed myself but for this business. Look there"&mdash;he pointed
with the handle of his razor to the table littered with
papers&mdash;"that's a bit of what I've had to do for you. I kind
o' think you ought to be grateful to your father, my gel."</p>
<p>I told him he was very kind, and then, very nervously, said:</p>
<p>"But are you sure it's quite right, sir?"</p>
<p>Not catching my meaning he laughed.</p>
<p>"Right?" he said, holding the point of his nose aside between
the tips of his left thumb and first finger. "Guess it's about as
right as law and wax can make it."</p>
<p>"I don't mean that, sir. I mean. . . ."</p>
<p>"What?" he said, facing round.</p>
<p>Then trembling and stammering I told him. I did not love Lord
Raa. Lord Raa did not love me. Therefore I begged him for my sake,
for his sake, for everybody's sake (I think I said for my mother's
sake also) to postpone our marriage.</p>
<p>At first my father seemed unable to believe his own ears.</p>
<p>"Postpone? Now? After all this money spent? And everything
signed and sealed and witnessed!"</p>
<p>"Yes, if you please, sir, because. . . ."</p>
<p>I got no farther, for flinging down his razor my father rose in
a towering rage.</p>
<p>"Are you mad? Has somebody been putting the evil eye on you? The
greatest match this island has ever seen, and you say
postpone&mdash;put it off, stop it, that's what you mean. Do you
want to make a fool of a man? At the last moment, too. Just when
there's nothing left but to go to the High Bailiff and the Church!
. . . But I see&mdash;I see what it is. It's that young
Conrad&mdash;he's been writing to you."</p>
<p>I tried to say no, but my father bore me down.</p>
<p>"Don't go to deny it, ma'am. He has been writing to every
one&mdash;the Bishop, Father Dan, myself even. Denouncing the
marriage if you plaze."</p>
<p>My father, in his great excitement, was breaking with withering
scorn into his native speech.</p>
<p>"Aw yes, though, denouncing and damning it, they're telling me!
Mighty neighbourly of him, I'm sure! Just a neighbour lad without a
penny at his back to take all that throuble! If I had known he felt
like that about it I might have axed his consent! The imperence,
though! The imperence of sin! A father has no rights, it seems! A
daughter is a separate being, and all to that! Well, well! Amazing
thick, isn't it?"</p>
<p>He was walking up and down the room with his heavy tread, making
the floor shake.</p>
<p>"Then that woman in Rome&mdash;I wouldn't trust but she has been
putting notions into your head, too. All the new-fangled fooleries,
I'll go bail. Women and men equal, not a ha'p'orth of difference
between them! The blatherskites!"</p>
<p>I was silenced, and I must have covered my face and cried, for
after a while my father softened, and touching my shoulder he asked
me if a man of sixty-five was not likely to know better than a girl
of nineteen what was good for her, and whether I supposed he had
not satisfied himself that this marriage was a good thing for me
and for him and for everybody.</p>
<p>"Do you think I'm not doing my best for you, gel&mdash;my very
best?"</p>
<p>I must have made some kind of assent, for he said:</p>
<p>"Then don't moither me any more, and don't let your Aunt Bridget
moither me&mdash;telling me and telling me what I might have done
for her own daughter instead."</p>
<p>At last, with a kind of rough tenderness, he took me by the arm
and raised me to my feet.</p>
<p>"There, there, go to bed and get some sleep. We'll have to start
off for the high Bailiff's early in the morning."</p>
<p>My will was broken down. I could resist no longer. Without a
word more I left him.</p>
<p>Returning to my room I took the letter I had been writing to
Father Dan and tore it up piece by piece. As I did so I felt as if
I were tearing up a living thing&mdash;something of myself, my
heart and all that was contained in it.</p>
<p>Then I threw open the window and leant out. I could hear the
murmur of the sea. I felt as if it were calling to me, though I
could not interpret its voice. The salt air was damp and it
refreshed my eyelids.</p>
<p>At length I got into bed, shivering with cold. When I had put
out the light I noticed that the moon, which was near the full, had
a big yellow ring of luminous vapour around it.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THIRTIETH_CHAPTER" id=
"THIRTIETH_CHAPTER"></a>THIRTIETH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>My sleep that night was much troubled by dreams. It was the same
dream as before, again and again repeated&mdash;the dream of frozen
regions and of the great ice barrier, and then of the broken
pen.</p>
<p>When I awoke in the hazy light of the dawn I thought of what the
Pope had said about beginning my wedding-day with penance and
communion, so I rose at once to go to church.</p>
<p>The dawn was broadening, but the household was still asleep,
only the servants in the kitchen stirring when I stepped through a
side door, and set out across the fields.</p>
<p>The dew was thick on the grass, and under the gloom of a heavy
sky the day looked cold and cheerless. A wind from the south-east
had risen during the night, the sea was white with breakers, and
from St. Mary's Rock there came the far-off moaning of surging
waves.</p>
<p>The church, too, when I reached it, looked empty and chill. The
sacristan in the dim choir was arranging lilies and marguerites
about the high altar, and only one poor woman, with a little red
and black shawl over her head and shoulders, was kneeling in the
side chapel where Father Dan was saying Mass, with a sleepy little
boy in clogs to serve him.</p>
<p>The woman was quite young, almost as young as myself, but she
was already a widow, having lately lost her husband "at the
herrings" somewhere up by Stornoway, where he had gone down in a
gale, leaving her with one child, a year old, and another soon to
come.</p>
<p>All this she told me the moment I knelt near her. The poor thing
seemed to think I ought to have remembered her, for she had been at
school with me in the village.</p>
<p>"I'm Bella Quark that was," she whispered. "I married Willie
Shimmin of the Lhen, you recollect. It's only a month this morning
since he was lost, but it seems like years and years. There isn't
nothing in the world like it."</p>
<p>She knew about my marriage, and said she wished me joy, though
the world was "so dark and lonely for some." Then she said
something about her "lil Willie." She had left him asleep in her
cottage on the Curragh, and he might awake and cry before she got
back, so she hoped Father Dan wouldn't keep her long.</p>
<p>I was so touched by the poor thing's trouble that I almost
forgot my own, and creeping up to her side I put my arm through
hers as we knelt together, and that was how the Father found us
when he turned to put the holy wafer on our tongues.</p>
<p>The wind must have risen higher while I was in the church, for
when I was returning across the fields it lashed my skirts about my
legs so that I could scarcely walk. A mist had come down and made a
sort of monotonous movement in the mountains where they touched the
vague line of the heavy sky.</p>
<p>I should be afraid to say that Nature was still trying to speak
to me in her strange inarticulate voice, but I cannot forget that a
flock of yearlings, which had been sheltering under a hedge,
followed me bleating to the last fence, and that the moaning of the
sea about St. Mary's Rock was the last sound I heard as I
re-entered the house.</p>
<p>Everything there was running like a mill-race by this time. The
servants were flying to and fro, my cousins were calling downstairs
in accents of alarm, Aunt Bridget was answering them in tones of
vexation, and my father was opening doors with a heavy push and
closing them with a clash.</p>
<p>They were all so suddenly pacified when I appeared that it
flashed upon me at the moment that they must have thought I had run
away.</p>
<p>"Goodness gracious me, girl, where have you been?" said Aunt
Bridget.</p>
<p>I told her, and she was beginning to reproach me for not
ordering round the carriage, instead of making my boots and
stockings damp by traipsing across the grass, when my father
said:</p>
<p>"That'll do, that'll do! Change them and take a snack of
something. I guess we're due at Holmtown in half an hour."</p>
<p>I ate my breakfast standing, the car was brought round, and by
eight o'clock my father and I arrived at the house of the High
Bailiff, who had to perform the civil ceremony of my marriage
according to the conditions required by law.</p>
<p>The High Bailiff was on one knee before the fire in his office,
holding a newspaper in front of it to make it burn.</p>
<p>"Nobody else here yet?" asked my father.</p>
<p>"Traa dy liooar" (time enough), the High Bailiff muttered.</p>
<p>He was an elderly man of intemperate habits who spent his nights
at the "Crown and Mitre," and was apparently out of humour at
having been brought out of bed so early.</p>
<p>His office was a room of his private house. It had a high desk,
a stool and a revolving chair. Placards were pinned on the walls,
one over another, and a Testament, with the binding much worn, lay
on a table. The place looked half like a doctor's consulting room,
and half like a small police court.</p>
<p>Presently Mr. Curphy, my father's advocate, came in, rather
irritatingly cheerful in that chill atmosphere, and, half an hour
late, my intended husband arrived, with his London lawyer and his
friend Eastcliff.</p>
<p>My mind was far from clear and I had a sense of seeing things by
flashes only, but I remember that I thought Lord Raa was very
nervous, and it even occurred to me that early as it was he had
been drinking.</p>
<p>"Beastly nuisance, isn't it?" he said to me aside, and then
there was something about "this legal fuss and fuddlement."</p>
<p>With the air of a man with a grievance the High Bailiff took a
big book out of the desk, and a smaller one off a shelf, and then
we sat in a half circle, and the ceremony began.</p>
<p>It was very brief and cold like a matter of business. As far as
I can remember it consisted of two declarations which Lord Raa and
I made first to the witnesses present and afterwards to each other.
One of them stated that we knew of no lawful impediment why we
should not be joined together in matrimony, and the other declared
that we were there and then so joined.</p>
<p>I remember that I repeated the words automatically, as the High
Bailiff in his thick alcoholic voice read them out of the smaller
of his books, and that Lord Raa, in tones of obvious impatience,
did the same.</p>
<p>Then the High Bailiff opened the bigger of his books, and after
writing something in it himself he asked Lord Raa to sign his name,
and this being done he asked me also.</p>
<p>"Am I to sign, too?" I asked, vacantly.</p>
<p>"Well, who else do you think?" said Mr. Curphy with a laugh.
"Betsy Beauty perhaps, eh?"</p>
<p>"Come, gel, come," said my father, sharply, and then I
signed.</p>
<p>I had no longer any will of my own. In this as in everything I
did whatever was asked of me.</p>
<p>It was all as dreary and lifeless as an empty house. I can
remember that it made no sensible impression upon my heart. My
father gave some money (a few shillings I think) to the High
Bailiff, who then tore a piece of perforated blue paper out of the
bigger of his books and offered it to me, saying:</p>
<p>"This belongs to you."</p>
<p>"To me?" I said.</p>
<p>"Who else?" said Mr. Curphy, who was laughing again, and then
something was said by somebody about marriage lines and no one
knowing when a wise woman might not want to use them.</p>
<p>The civil ceremony of my marriage was now over, and Lord Raa,
who had been very restless, rose to his feet, saying:</p>
<p>"Beastly early drive. Anything in the house to steady one's
nerves, High Bailiff?"</p>
<p>The High Bailiff made some reply, at which the men laughed, all
except my father. Then they left me and went into another room, the
dining-room, and I heard the jingling of glasses and the drinking
of healths while I sat before the fire with my foot on the fender
and my marriage lines in my hand.</p>
<p>My brain was still numbed. I felt as one might feel if drowned
in the sea and descending, without quite losing consciousness, to
the depths of its abyss.</p>
<p>I remember I thought that what I had just gone through differed
in no respect from the signing of my marriage settlement, except
that in the one case I had given my husband rights over my money,
my father's money, whereas in this case I seemed to have given him
rights over myself.</p>
<p>Otherwise it was all so cold, so drear, so dead, so
unaffecting.</p>
<p>The blue paper had slipped out of my hand on to the worn
hearthrug when my helpless meditations were interrupted by the
thrumming and throbbing of the motor-car outside, and by my father,
who was at the office door, saying in his loud, commanding
voice:</p>
<p>"Come, gel, guess it's time for you to be back."</p>
<p>Half an hour afterwards I was in my own room at home, and given
over to the dressmakers. I was still being moved
automatically&mdash;a creature without strength or will.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THIRTY_FIRST_CHAPTER" id=
"THIRTY_FIRST_CHAPTER"></a>THIRTY-FIRST CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I have only an indefinite memory of floating vaguely through the
sights and sounds of the next two hours&mdash;of everybody except
myself being wildly excited; of my cousins railing repeatedly from
unseen regions of the house: of Aunt Bridget scolding
indiscriminately; of the dressmakers chattering without ceasing as
they fitted on my wedding dress; of their standing off from me at
intervals with cries of delight at the success of their efforts; of
the wind roaring in the chimney; of the church-bells ringing in the
distance; of the ever-increasing moaning of the sea about St.
Mary's Rock; and finally of the rumbling of the rubber wheels of
several carriages and the plash of horses' hoofs on the gravel of
the drive.</p>
<p>When the dressmakers were done with me I was wearing an ivory
satin dress, embroidered in silver, with a coronal of myrtle and
orange blossoms under the old Limerick lace of the family veil, as
well as a string of pearls and one big diamond of the noble house I
was marrying into. I remember they said my black hair shone with a
blue lustre against the sparkling gem, and I dare say I looked gay
on the outside anyway.</p>
<p>At last I heard a fluttering of silk outside my room, and a
running stream of chatter going down the stairs, followed by the
banging of carriage doors, and then my father's deep voice,
saying:</p>
<p>"Bride ready? Good! Time to go, I guess."</p>
<p>He alone had made no effort to dress himself up, for he was
still wearing his every-day serge and his usual heavy boots. There
was not even a flower in his button-hole.</p>
<p>We did not speak very much on our way to church, but I found a
certain comfort in his big warm presence as we sat together in the
carriage with the windows shut, for the rising storm was beginning
to frighten me.</p>
<p>"It will be nothing," said my father. "Just a puff of wind and a
slant of rain maybe."</p>
<p>The little church was thronged with people. Even the galleries
were full of the children from the village school. There was a
twittering overhead like that of young birds in a tree, and as I
walked up the nave on my father's arm I could not help but hear
over the sound of the organ the whispered words of the people in
the pews on either side of us.</p>
<p>"Dear heart alive, the straight like her mother she is, bless
her!"</p>
<p>"Goodness yes, it's the poor misfortunate mother come to life
again."</p>
<p>"Deed, but the daughter's in luck, though."</p>
<p>Lord Raa was waiting for me by the communion rail. He looked yet
more nervous than in the morning, and, though he was trying to bear
himself with his usual composure, there was (or I thought there
was) a certain expression of fear in his face which I had never
seen before.</p>
<p>His friend and witness, Mr. Eastcliff, wearing a carnation
button-hole, was by his side, and his aunt, Lady Margaret, carrying
a sheaf of beautiful white flowers, was standing near.</p>
<p>My own witnesses and bridesmaids, Betsy Beauty and Nessy
MacLeod, in large hats, with soaring black feathers, were behind
me. I could hear the rustle of their rose-coloured skirts and the
indistinct buzz of their whispered conversation, as well as the
more audible reproofs of Aunt Bridget, who in a crinkly black silk
dress and a bonnet like a half moon, was telling them to be silent
and to look placid.</p>
<p>At the next moment I was conscious that a bell had been rung in
the chancel; that the organ had stopped; that the coughing and
hemming in the church had ceased; that somebody was saying "Stand
here, my lord"; that Lord Raa, with a nervous laugh, was asking
"Here?" and taking a place by my side; that the lighted altar,
laden with flowers, was in front of me; and that the Bishop in his
vestments, Father Dan in his surplice and white stole, and a clerk
carrying a book and a vessel of holy water were beginning the
service.</p>
<p>Surely never was there a sadder ceremony. Never did any girl
under similar circumstances feel a more vivid presentiment of the
pains and penalties that follow on a forced and ill-assorted
marriage. And yet there came to me in the course of the service
such a startling change of thought as wiped out for a while all my
sadness, made me forget the compulsion that had been put upon me,
and lifted me into a realm of spiritual ecstasy.</p>
<p>The Bishop began with a short litany which asked God's blessing
on the ceremony which was to join together two of His children in
the bonds of holy wedlock. While that was going on I was conscious
of nothing except the howling of the wind about the church windows
and the far-off tolling of the bell on St. Mary's
Rock&mdash;nothing but this and a voice within me which seemed to
say again and again, "I don't love him! I don't love him!"</p>
<p>But hardly had the actual ceremony commenced when I began to be
overawed by the solemnity and divine power of the service, and by
the sense of God leaning over my littleness and guiding me
according to His will.</p>
<p>What did it matter how unworthy were the preparations that had
led up to this marriage if God was making it? God makes all
marriages that are blessed by His Church, and therefore He
overrules to His own good ends all human impulses, however sordid
or selfish they may be.</p>
<p>After that thought came to me nothing else seemed to matter, and
nothing, however jarring or incongruous, was able to lower the
exaltation of my spirit.</p>
<p>But the service, which had this effect upon me, appeared to have
an exactly opposite effect on Lord Raa. His nervousness increased
visibly, though he did his best to conceal it by a lightness of
manner that sometimes looked like derision.</p>
<p>Thus when the Bishop stepped down to us and said:</p>
<p>"James Charles Munster, wilt thou take Mary here present for thy
lawful wife, according to the rite of our holy Mother the Church,"
my husband halted and stammered over his answer, saying beneath his
breath, "I thought I was a heretic."</p>
<p>But when the corresponding question was put to me, and Father
Dan thinking I must be nervous, leaned over me and whispered,
"Don't worry, child, take your time," I replied a loud, clear,
unfaltering voice:</p>
<p>"I will."</p>
<p>And again, when my husband had to put the ring and the gold and
silver on the salver (he fumbled and dropped them as he did so, and
fumbled and dropped them a second time when he had to take them up
after they had been blessed, laughing too audibly at his own
awkwardness), and then repeat after the Bishop:</p>
<p>"With this ring I thee wed; this gold and silver I thee give;
with my body I thee worship; and with all my worldly goods I thee
endow," he tendered the ring slowly and with an obvious effort.</p>
<p>But I took it without trembling, because I was thinking that, in
spite of all I had heard of his ways of life, this solemn and
sacred sacrament made him mine and no one else's.</p>
<p>It is all very mysterious; I cannot account for it; I only know
it was so, and that, everything considered, it was perhaps the
strangest fact of all my life.</p>
<p>I remember that more than once during the ceremony Father Dan
spoke to me softly and caressingly, as if to a child, but I felt no
need of his comforting, for my strength was from a higher
source.</p>
<p>I also remember that it was afterwards said that all through the
ceremony the eyes of the newly-wedded couple seemed sedulously to
shun each other, but if I did not look at my husband it was because
my marriage was like a prayer to me, carrying me back, with its
sense of purity and sanctity, to the little sunlit church in Rome
where Mildred Bankes had taken her vows.</p>
<p>After the marriage service there was Nuptial Mass and
Benediction (special dispensation from Rome), and that raised to a
still higher pitch the spiritual exaltation which sustained me.</p>
<p>Father Dan read the Epistle beginning "Let wives be subject to
their husbands," and then the Bishop read the Gospel, concluding,
"Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh: what therefore God
hath joined together, let not man put asunder."</p>
<p>I had trembled when I thought of these solemn and sonorous words
in the solitude of my own room, but now that they were spoken
before the congregation I had no fear, no misgiving, nothing but a
sense of rapture and consecration.</p>
<p>The last words being spoken and Lord Raa and I being man and
wife, we stepped into the sacristy to sign the register, and not
even there did my spirit fail me. I took up the pen and signed my
name without a tremor. But hardly had I done so when I heard a
rumbling murmur of voices about me&mdash;first the Bishop's voice
(in such a worldly tone) and then my father's and then my
husband's, and then the voices of many others, in light
conversation mingled with trills of laughter. And then, in a
moment, in a twinkling, as fast as a snowflake melts upon a stream,
the spell of the marriage service seemed to break.</p>
<p>I have heard since that my eyes were wet at that moment and I
seemed to have been crying all through the ceremony. I know nothing
about that, but I do know that I felt a kind of internal shudder
and that it was just as if my soul had suddenly awakened from an
intoxicating drug.</p>
<p>The organ began to play the Wedding March, and my husband,
putting my arm through his, said, "Come."</p>
<p>There was much audible whispering among the people waiting for
us in the church, and as we walked towards the door I saw ghostly
faces smiling at me on every side, and heard ghostly voices
speaking in whispers that were like the backward plash of wavelets
on the shore.</p>
<p>"Sakes alive, how white's she's looking, though," said somebody,
and then somebody else said&mdash;I could not help but hear
it&mdash;</p>
<p>"Dear heart knows if her father has done right for all
that."</p>
<p>I did not look at anybody, but I saw Martin's mother at the
back, and she was wiping her eyes and saying to some one by her
side&mdash;it must have been the doctor&mdash;</p>
<p>"God bless her for the sweet child veen she always was,
anyway."</p>
<p>The storm had increased during the service; and the sacristan,
who was opening the door for us, had as much as he could do to hold
it against the wind, which came with such a rush upon us when we
stepped into the porch that my veil and the coronal of myrtle and
orange blossoms were torn off my head and blown back into the
church.</p>
<p>"God bless my sowl," said somebody&mdash;it was Tommy's friend,
Johnny Christopher&mdash;"there's some ones would he calling that
bad luck, though."</p>
<p>A band of village musicians, who were ranged up in the road,
struck up "The Black and Grey" as we stepped out of the churchyard,
and the next thing I knew was that my husband and I were in the
carriage going home.</p>
<p>He had so far recovered from the frightening effects of the
marriage service that he was making light of it, and saying:</p>
<p>"When will this mummery come to an end, I wonder?"</p>
<p>The windows of the carriage were rattling with the wind, and my
husband had begun to talk of the storm when we came upon the trunk
of a young tree which had been torn up by the roots and was lying
across the road, so that our coachman had to get down and remove
it.</p>
<p>"Beastly bad crossing, I'm afraid. Hope you're a good sailor.
Must be in London to-morrow morning, you know."</p>
<p>The band was playing behind us. The leafless trees were beating
their bare boughs in front. The wedding bells were pealing. The
storm was thundering through the running sky. The sea was very
loud.</p>
<p>At my father's gate Tommy the Mate, with a serious face, was
standing, cap in hand, under his triumphal arch, which (as well as
it could for the wind that was tearing its flowers and scattering
them on the ground) spelled out the words "God bless the Happy
Bride."</p>
<p>When we reached the open door of the house a group of maids were
waiting for us. They were holding on to their white caps and trying
to control their aprons, which were swirling about their black
frocks. As I stepped out of the carriage they addressed me as "My
lady" and "Your ladyship." The seagulls, driven up from the sea,
were screaming about the house.</p>
<p>My husband and I went into the drawing-room, and as we stood
together on the hearthrug I caught a glimpse of my face in the
glass over the mantelpiece. It was deadly white, and had big
staring eyes and a look of faded sunshine. I fixed afresh the
pearls about my neck and the diamond in my hair, which was much
disordered.</p>
<p>Almost immediately the other carriages returned, and relatives
and guests began to pour into the room and offer us their
congratulations. First came my cousins, who were too much troubled
about their own bedraggled appearance to pay much attention to
mine. Then Aunt Bridget, holding on to her half-moon bonnet and
crying:</p>
<p>"You happy, happy child! But what a wind! There's been nothing
like it since the day you were born."</p>
<p>My father came next, like a gale of wind himself, saying:</p>
<p>"I'm proud of you, gel. Right proud I am. You done well."</p>
<p>Then came Lady Margaret, who kissed me without saying many
words, and finally a large and varied company of gaily-dressed
friends and neighbours, chiefly the "aristocracy" of our island,
who lavished many unnecessary "ladyships" upon me, as if the great
name reflected a certain glory upon themselves.</p>
<p>I remember that as I stood on the hearthrug with my husband,
receiving their rather crude compliments, a vague gaiety came over
me, and I smiled and laughed, although my heart was growing sick,
for the effect of the wedding-service was ebbing away into a cold
darkness like that of a night tide when the moonlight has left
it.</p>
<p>It did not comfort me that my husband, without failing in good
manners, was taking the whole scene and company with a certain
scarcely-veiled contempt which I could not help but see.</p>
<p>And neither did it allay my uneasiness to glance at my father,
where he stood at the end of the room, watching, with a look of
triumph in his glistening black eyes, his proud guests coming up to
me one by one, and seeming to say to himself, "They're here at
last! I've bet them! Yes, by gough, I've bet them!"</p>
<p>Many a time since I have wondered if his conscience did not stir
within him as he looked across at his daughter in the jewels of the
noble house he had married her into&mdash;the pale bride with the
bridegroom he had bought for her&mdash;and thought of the mockery
of a sacred union which he had brought about to gratify his pride,
his vanity, perhaps his revenge.</p>
<p>But it was all over now. I was married to Lord Raa. In the eyes
equally of the law, the world and the Church, the knot between us
was irrevocably tied.</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM BY MARTIN CONRAD</p>
<p>I am no mystic and no spiritualist, and I only mention it as one
of the mysteries of human sympathy between far-distant friends,
that during a part of the time when my dear one was going through
the fierce struggle she describes, and was dreaming of frozen
regions and a broken pen, the ship I sailed on had got itself stuck
fast in a field of pack ice in latitude 76, under the ice barrier
by Charcot Bay, and that while we were lying like helpless logs,
cut off from communication with the world, unable to do anything
but groan and swear and kick our heels in our bunks at every fresh
grinding of our crunching sides, my own mind, sleeping and waking,
was for ever swinging back, with a sort of yearning prayer to my
darling not to yield to the pressure which I felt so damnably sure
was being brought to bear on her.</p>

<p>When the Bishop and Father Dan arrived, the bell was rung and we
went in to breakfast.</p>
<p>We breakfasted in the new dining-room, which was now finished
and being used for the first time.</p>
<p>It was a gorgeous chamber beblazoned with large candelabra, huge
mirrors, and pictures in gold frames&mdash;resembling the room it
was intended to imitate, yet not resembling it, as a woman
over-dressed resembles a well-dressed woman.</p>
<p>My father sat at the head of his table with the Bishop, Lady
Margaret and Aunt Bridget on his right, and myself, my husband,
Betsy Beauty and Mr. Eastcliff on his left. The lawyers and the
trustee were midway down, Father Dan with Nessy MacLeod was at the
end, and a large company of our friends and neighbours, wearing
highly-coloured flowers on their breasts and in their buttonholes,
sat between.</p>
<p>The meal was very long, and much of the food was very
large&mdash;large fish, large roasts of venison, veal, beef and
mutton, large puddings and large cheeses, all cut on the table and
served by waiters from Blackwater. There were two long black lines
of them&mdash;a waiter behind the chair of nearly every other
guest.</p>
<p>All through the breakfast the storm raged outside. More than
once it drowned the voices of the people at the table, roaring like
a wild beast in the great throat of the wide chimney, swirling
about the lantern light, licking and lashing and leaping at the
outsides of the walls like lofty waves breaking against a
breakwater, and sending up a thunderous noise from the sea itself,
where the big bell of St. Mary's Rock was still tolling like a
knell.</p>
<p>Somebody&mdash;it must have been Aunt Bridget again&mdash;said
there had been nothing like it since the day of my birth, and it
must be "fate."</p>
<p>"Chut, woman!" said my father. "We're living in the twentieth
century. Who's houlding with such ould wife's wonders now?"</p>
<p>He was intensely excited, and, his excitement betrayed itself,
as usual, in reversion to his native speech. Sometimes he surveyed
in silence, with the old masterful lift of his eyebrows, his
magnificent room and the great guests who were gathered within it;
sometimes he whispered to the waiters to be smarter with the
serving of the dishes; and sometimes he pitched his voice above the
noises within and without and shouted, in country-fashion, to his
friends at various points of the table to know how they were
faring.</p>
<p>"How are you doing, Mr. Curphy, sir?"</p>
<p>"Doing well, sir. Are you doing well yourself, Mr. O'Neill,
sir?"</p>
<p>"Lord-a-massy yes, sir. I'm always doing well, sir."</p>
<p>Never had anybody in Ellan seen so strange a mixture of grandeur
and country style. My husband seemed to be divided between amused
contempt for it, and a sense of being compromised by its pretence.
More than once I saw him, with his monocle in his eye, look round
at his friend Eastcliff, but he helped himself frequently from a
large decanter of brandy and drank healths with everybody.</p>
<p>There were the usual marriage pleasantries, facetious
compliments and chaff, in which to my surprise (the solemnity of
the service being still upon me) the Bishop permitted himself to
join.</p>
<p>I was now very nervous, and yet I kept up a forced gaiety,
though my heart was cold and sick. I remember that I had a
preternatural power of hearing at the same time nearly every
conversation that was going on at the table, and that I joined in
nearly all the laughter.</p>
<p>At a more than usually loud burst of wind somebody said it would
be a mercy if the storm did not lift the roof off.</p>
<p>"Chut, man!" cried my father. "Solid oak and wrought iron here.
None of your mouldy old monuments that have enough to do to keep
their tiles on."</p>
<p>"Then nobody," said my husband with a glance at his friend,
"need be afraid of losing his head in your house, sir?"</p>
<p>"Not if he's got one to come in with, sir."</p>
<p>Betsy Beauty, sitting next to Mr. Eastcliff, was wondering if he
would do us the honour to visit the island oftener now that his
friend had married into it.</p>
<p>"But, my dear Betsy," said my husband, "who would live in this
God-forsaken place if he could help it?"</p>
<p>"God-forsaken, is it?" said my father. "Maybe so, sir&mdash;but
that's what the cuckoo said after he had eaten the eggs out of the
thrush's nest and left a mess in it."</p>
<p>Aunt Bridget was talking in doleful tones to Lady Margaret about
my mother, saying she had promised her on her death-bed to take
care of her child and had been as good as her word, always putting
me before her own daughter, although her ladyship would admit that
Betsy was a handsome girl, and, now that his lordship was married,
there were few in the island that were fit for her.</p>
<p>"Why no, Mrs. MacLeod," said my husband, after another
significant glance at his friend, "I dare say you've not got many
who can make enough to keep a carriage?"</p>
<p>"Truth enough, sir," said my father. "We've got hundreds and
tons that can make debts though."</p>
<p>The breakfast came to an end at length, and almost before the
last of the waiters had left the room my father rose to speak.</p>
<p>"Friends all," he said, "the young married couple have to leave
us for the afternoon steamer."</p>
<p>"In this weather?" said somebody, pointing up to the lantern
light through which the sky was now darkening.</p>
<p>"Chut! A puff of wind and a slant of rain, as I've been saying
to my gel here. But my son-in-law, Lord Raa," (loud cheers followed
this description, with some laughter and much hammering on the
table), "my son-in-law says he has to be in London to-morrow, and
this morning my daughter has sworn obedience. . . . What's that,
Monsignor? Not obedience exactly? Something like it then, so she's
bound to go along with him. So fill up your glasses to the brim and
drink to the bride and bridegroom."</p>
<p>As soon as the noise made by the passing of decanters had died
down my father spoke again.</p>
<p>"This is the proudest day of my life. It's the day I've worked
for and slaved for and saved for, and it's come to pass at
last."</p>
<p>There was another chorus of applause.</p>
<p>"What's that you were saying in church, Mr. Curphy, sir? Time
brings in its revenges? It does too. Look at me."</p>
<p>My father put his thumbs in the arm-pits of his waistcoat.</p>
<p>"You all know what I am, and where I come from."</p>
<p>My husband put his monocle to his eye and looked up.</p>
<p>"I come from a mud cabin on the Curragh, not a hundred miles
from here. My father was kill . . . but never mind about that now.
When he left us it was middling hard collar work, I can tell
you&mdash;what with me working the bit of a croft and the mother
weeding for some of you&mdash;some of your fathers I
mane&mdash;ninepence a day dry days, and sixpence all weathers.
When I was a lump of a lad I was sworn at in the high road by a
gentleman driving in his grand carriage, and the mother was lashed
by his . . . but never mind about that neither. I guess I've
hustled round considerable since then, and this morning I've
married my daughter into the first family in the island."</p>
<p>There was another burst of cheering at this, but it was almost
drowned by the loud rattling of the rain which was now falling on
the lantern light.</p>
<p>"Monsignor," cried my father, pitching his voice still higher,
"what's that you were saying in Rome about the mills of God?"</p>
<p>Fumbling his jewelled cross and smiling blandly the Bishop gave
my father the familiar quotation.</p>
<p>"Truth enough, too. The mills of God grind slowly but they're
grinding exceeding small. Nineteen years ago I thought I was as
sure of what I wanted as when I got out of bed this morning. If my
gel here had been born a boy, my son would have sat where his
lordship is now sitting. But all's well that ends well! If I
haven't got a son I've got a son-in-law, and when I get a grandson
he'll be the richest man that ever stepped into Castle Raa, and the
uncrowned king of Ellan."</p>
<p>At that there was a tempest of cheers, which, mingling with the
clamour of the storm, made a deafening tumult.</p>
<p>"They're saying a dale nowadays about fathers and
children&mdash;daughters being separate beings, and all to that.
But show me the daughter that could do better for herself than my
gel's father has done for her. She has a big fortune, and her
husband has a big name, and what more do they want in this world
anyway?"</p>
<p>"Nothing at all," came from various parts of the room.</p>
<p>"Neighbours," said my father, looking round him with a satisfied
smile, "I'm laying you dry as herrings in a hould, but before I
call on you to drink this toast I'll ask the Bishop to spake to
you. He's a grand man is the Bishop, and in fixing up this marriage
I don't in the world know what I could have done without him."</p>
<p>The Bishop, still fingering his jewelled cross and smiling,
spoke in his usual suave voice. He firmly believed that the Church
had that morning blessed a most propitious and happy union.
Something might be said against mixed marriages, but under proper
circumstances the Church had never forbidden them and his lordship
(this with a deep bow to my husband) had behaved with great
liberality of mind.</p>
<p>As for what their genial and rugged host had said of certain
foolish and dangerous notions about the relations of father and
child, he was reminded that there were still more foolish and
dangerous ones about the relations of husband and wife.</p>
<p>From the earliest ages of the Church, however, those relations
had been exactly defined. "Let wives be subject to their husbands,"
said the Epistle we had read this morning, and no less conclusive
had been our closing prayer, asking that the wife keep true faith
with her husband, being lovely in his eyes even as was Rachel, wise
as was Rebecca, and dutiful as was Sara.</p>
<p>"Beautiful!" whispered Aunt Bridget to Lady Margaret. "It's what
I always was myself in the days of the dear Colonel."</p>
<p>"And now," said the Bishop, "before you drink this toast and
call upon the noble bridegroom to respond to it," (another deep bow
to my husband), "I will ask for a few words from the two legal
gentlemen who have carried out the admirably judicious financial
arrangements without which this happy marriage would have been
difficult if not impossible."</p>
<p>Then my husband's lawyer, with a supercilious smile on his
clean-shaven face, said it had been an honour to him to assist in
preparing the way for the "uncrowned king of Ellan." ("It
<i>has</i>, sir," cried my father in a loud voice which
straightened the gentleman's face instantly); and finally Mr.
Curphy, speaking through his long beard, congratulated my father
and my husband equally on the marriage, and gave it as his opinion
that there could be no better use for wealth than to come to the
rescue of an historic family which had fallen on evil times and
only required a little money to set it on its feet again.</p>
<p>"The bride and bridegroom!" cried my father; and then everybody
rose and there was much cheering, with cries of "His lordship,"
"His lordship."</p>
<p>All through the speech-making my husband had rolled uneasily in
his chair. He had also helped himself frequently from the decanter,
so that when he got up to reply he was scarcely sober.</p>
<p>In his drawling voice he thanked the Bishop, and said that
having made up his mind to the marriage he had never dreamt of
raising difficulties about religion. As to the modern notions about
the relations of husband and wife, he did not think a girl brought
up in a convent would give him much trouble on that subject.</p>
<p>"Not likely," cried my father. "I'll clear her of that
anyway."</p>
<p>"So I thank you for myself and for my family," continued my
husband, "and . . . Oh, yes, of course," (this to Lady Margaret).
"I thank you for my wife also, and . . . and that's all."</p>
<p>I felt sick and cold and ashamed. A rush of blood came under the
skin of my face that must have made me red to the roots of my
hair.</p>
<p>In all this speaking about my marriage there had not been one
word about myself&mdash;myself really, a living soul with all her
future happiness at stake. I cannot say what vague impulse took
possession of me, but I remember that when my husband sat down I
made a forced laugh, though I knew well that I wanted to cry.</p>
<p>In an agony of shame I was beginning to feel a wild desire to
escape from the room and even from the house, that I might breathe
in some of the free wind outside, when all at once I became aware
that somebody else was speaking.</p>
<p>It was Father Dan. He had risen unannounced from his seat at the
end of the table. I saw his sack coat which was much worn at the
seams; I saw his round face which was flushed; I heard the
vibrating note in his soft Irish voice which told me he was deeply
moved; and then I dropped my head, for I knew what was coming.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THIRTY_THIRD_CHAPTER" id=
"THIRTY_THIRD_CHAPTER"></a>THIRTY-THIRD CHAPTER</h2>
<p>"Mr. O'Neill," said Father Dan, "may your parish priest take the
liberty of speaking without being spoken to?"</p>
<p>My father made some response, and then a hush fell over the
dining-room. Either the storm ceased for a time, or in my great
agitation it seemed to do so, for I did not hear it.</p>
<p>"We have heard a great deal about the marriage we have
celebrated to-day, but have we not forgotten something? What
<i>is</i> marriage? Is it the execution of a contract? Is it the
signing of a register? Is it even the taking of an oath before an
altar? No. Marriage is the sacred covenant which two souls make
with each other, the woman with the man, the man with the woman,
when she chooses him from all other men, when he chooses her from
all other women, to belong to each other for ever, so that no
misfortune, no storm of life, no sin on either side shall ever put
them apart. That's what marriage is, and all we have been doing
to-day is to call on God and man to bear witness to that holy
bond."</p>
<p>My heart was beating high. I raised my head, and I think my eyes
must have been shining. I looked across at the Bishop. His face was
showing signs of vexation.</p>
<p>"Mr. O'Neill, sir," cried Father Dan, raising his trembling
voice, "you say your daughter has a big fortune and her husband has
a big name, and what more do they want in this world? I'll tell you
what they want, sir. They want love, love on both sides, if they
are to be good and happy, and if they've got that they've got
something which neither wealth nor rank can buy."</p>
<p>I had dropped my head again, but under my eyelashes I could see
that the company were sitting spell-bound. Only my husband was
shuffling in his seat, and the Bishop was plucking at his gold
chain.</p>
<p>"My Bishop," said Father Dan, "has told us of the submission a
wife owes to her husband, and of her duty to be lovely and wise and
faithful in his eyes. But isn't it the answering thought that the
husband on his part owes something to the wife? Aren't we told that
he shall put away everything and everybody for her sake, and cleave
to her and cling to her and they shall be one flesh? Isn't that,
too, a divine commandment?"</p>
<p>My heart was throbbing so loud by this time that the next words
were lost to me. When I came to myself again Father Dan was
saying:</p>
<p>"Think what marriage means to a woman&mdash;a young girl
especially. It means the breaking of old ties, the beginning of a
new life, the setting out into an unknown world on a voyage from
which there can be no return. In her weakness and her helplessness
she leaves one dependency for another, the shelter of a father for
the shelter of a husband. What does she bring to the man she
marries? Herself, everything she is, everything she can be, to be
made or marred by him, and never, never, never to be the same to
any other man whatsoever as long as life shall last."</p>
<p>More than ever now, but for other reasons, I wanted to fly from
the room.</p>
<p>"Friends," cried Father Dan, "we don't know much of the
bridegroom in this parish, but we know the bride. We've known her
all her life. We know what she is. I do, anyway. If you are her
father, Mr. O'Neill, sir, I am her father also. I was in this house
when she was born. I baptized her. I took her out of the arms of
the angel who bore her. So she's my child too, God bless her. . .
."</p>
<p>His voice was breaking&mdash;I was sobbing&mdash;though he was
speaking so loudly I could scarcely hear him&mdash;I could scarcely
see him&mdash;I only knew that he was facing about in our direction
and raising his trembling hand to my husband.</p>
<p>"She is my child, too, I say, and now that she is leaving us,
now that you are taking her away from us, I charge you, my lord, to
be good and faithful to her, as you will have to answer for her
soul some day."</p>
<p>What else he said I do not know. From that moment I was blind
and deaf to everything. Nevertheless I was conscious that after
Father Dan had ceased to speak there was a painful silence. I
thought the company seemed to be startled and even a little annoyed
by the emotion so suddenly shot into their midst. The Bishop looked
vexed, my father looked uncomfortable, and my husband, who had been
drinking glass after glass of brandy, was muttering something about
"a sermon."</p>
<p>It had been intended that Mr. Eastcliff should speak for the
bridesmaids, and I was afterwards told by Betsy Beauty that he had
prepared himself with many clever epigrams, but everybody felt
there could be no more speaking of any kind now. After a few
awkward moments my father looked at his watch and said it was about
time for us to start if we were to catch the steamer, so I was
hurried upstairs to change for our journey.</p>
<p>When I came down again, in my tailor-made travelling dress with
sables, the whole company was in the hall and everybody seemed to
be talking at the same time, making a noise like water in a
weir.</p>
<p>I was taken possession of by each in turn. Nessy MacLeod told me
in an aside what an excellent father I had. Betsy Beauty whispered
that Mr. Eastcliff was so handsome and their tastes were so similar
that she hoped I would invite him to Castle Raa as soon as I came
back. Aunt Bridget, surrounded by a group of sympathising ladies
(including Lady Margaret, who was making an obvious effort to be
gracious) was wiping her eyes and saying I had always been her
favourite and she had faithfully done her duty by me.</p>
<p>"Mary, my love," she said, catching my eye, "I'm just telling
her ladyship I don't know in the world what I'll do when you are
gone."</p>
<p>My husband was there too, wearing a heavy overcoat with the
collar up, and receiving from a group of insular gentlemen their
cheerful prognostics of a bad passage.</p>
<p>"'Deed, but I'm fearing it will be a dirty passage, my
lord."</p>
<p>"Chut!" said my father. "The wind's from the south-west. They'll
soon get shelter."</p>
<p>The first of our two cars came round and my husband's valet went
off in advance with our luggage. Then the second car arrived, and
the time came for our departure. I think I kissed everybody.
Everybody seemed to be crying&mdash;everybody except myself, for my
tears were all gone by this time.</p>
<p>Just as we were about to start, the storm, which must certainly
have fallen for a while, sprang up suddenly, and when Tommy the
Mate (barely recognisable in borrowed black garments) opened the
door the wind came rushing into the house with a long-drawn
whirr.</p>
<p>I had said good-bye to the old man, and was stepping into the
porch when I remembered Father Dan. He was standing in his shabby
sack coat with a sorrowful face in a dark corner by the door, as if
he had placed himself there to see the last of me. I wanted to put
my arms around his neck, but I knew that would be wrong, so I
dropped to my knees and kissed his hand and he gave me his
blessing.</p>
<p>My husband, who was waiting by the side of the throbbing
automobile, said impatiently:</p>
<p>"Come, come, dear, don't keep me in the rain."</p>
<p>I got into the landaulette, my husband got in after me, the car
began to move, there were cries from within the house ("Good-bye!"
"Good luck") which sounded like stifled shrieks as they were
carried off by the wind without, and then we were under weigh.</p>
<p>As we turned the corner of the drive something prompted me to
look back at my mother's window&mdash;with its memories of my first
going to school.</p>
<p>At the next moment we were crossing the bridge&mdash;with its
memories of Martin Conrad and William Rufus.</p>
<p>At the next we were on the road.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THIRTY_FOURTH_CHAPTER" id=
"THIRTY_FOURTH_CHAPTER"></a>THIRTY-FOURTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>"Thank God, that's over," said my husband. Then, half
apologetically, he added: "You didn't seem to enjoy it any more
than myself, my dear."</p>
<p>At the entrance to our village a number of men stood firing
guns; in the middle a group of girls were stretching a rope across
the road; a number of small flags, torn by the wind and wet with
the rain, were rattling on flagstaffs hung out from some of the
window sills; a few women, with shawls over their heads, were
sheltering on the weather side of their porches to see us pass.</p>
<p>My husband was impatient of our simple island customs. Once or
twice he lowered the window of the car, threw out a handful of
silver and at the same time urged the chauffeur to drive quicker.
As soon as we were clear of the village he fell back in his seat,
saying:</p>
<p>"Heavens, how sleepy I am! No wonder either! Late going to bed
last night and up so early this morning."</p>
<p>After a moment he began to yawn, and almost before he could have
been aware of it he had closed his eyes. At the next moment he was
asleep.</p>
<p>It was a painful, almost a hideous sleep. His cheeks swelled and
sank; his lips parted, he was breathing heavily, and sometimes
gaping like a carp out of water.</p>
<p>I could not detach my eyes from his face, which, without eyes to
relieve it, seemed to be almost repulsive now. It would be
difficult to describe my sensations. I felt dreadfully humiliated.
Even my personal pride was wounded. I remembered what Father Dan
had said about husband and wife being one flesh, and told myself
that <i>this</i> was what I belonged to, what belonged to
me&mdash;<i>this!</i> Then I tried to reproach and reprove myself,
but in order to do so I had to turn my eyes away.</p>
<p>Our road to Blackwater lay over the ridge of a hill much exposed
to the wind from the south-west. When we reached this point the
clouds seemed to roll up from the sea like tempestuous battalions.
Torrential rain fell on the car and came dripping in from the
juncture of the landaulette roof. Some of it fell on the sleeper
and he awoke with a start.</p>
<p>"Damn&mdash;"</p>
<p>He stopped, as if, caught in guilt, and began to apologise
again.</p>
<p>"Was I asleep? I really think I must have been. Stupid, isn't
it? Excuse me."</p>
<p>He blinked his eyes as if to empty them of sleep, looked me over
for a moment or two in silence, and then said with a smile which
made me shudder:</p>
<p>"So you and I are man and wife, my dear!"</p>
<p>I made no answer, and, still looking fixedly at me, he said:</p>
<p>"Well, worse things might have happened after all&mdash;what do
<i>you</i> think?"</p>
<p>Still I did not answer him, feeling a certain shame, not to say
disgust. Then he began to pay me some compliments on my
appearance.</p>
<p>"Do you know you're charming, my dear, really charming!"</p>
<p>That stung me, and made me shudder, I don't know why, unless it
was because the words gave me the sense of having been used before
to other women. I turned my eyes away again.</p>
<p>"Don't turn away, dear. Let me see those big black eyes of
yours. I adore black eyes. They always pierce me like a
gimlet."</p>
<p>He reached forward as he spoke and drew me to him. I felt
frightened and pushed him off.</p>
<p>"What's this?" he said, as if surprised.</p>
<p>But after another moment he laughed, and in the tone of a man
who had had much to do with women and thought he knew how to deal
with them, he said:</p>
<p>"Wants to be coaxed, does she? They all do, bless them!"</p>
<p>Saying this he pulled me closer to him, putting his arm about my
waist, but once more I drew and forcibly pushed him from me.</p>
<p>His face darkened for an instant, and then cleared again.</p>
<p>"Oh, I see," he said. "Offended, is she? Paying me out for
having paid so little court to her? Well, she's right there too,
bless her! But never mind! You're a decidedly good-looking little
woman, my dear, and if I have neglected you thus far, I intend to
make up for it during the honeymoon. So come, little gal, let's be
friends."</p>
<p>Taking hold of me again, he tried to kiss me, putting at the
same time his hand on the bosom of my dress, but I twisted my face
aside and prevented him.</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh! Hurt her modesty, have I?" he said, laughing like a man
who was quite sure both of himself and of me. "But my little nun
will get over that by and by. Wait awhile! Wait awhile!"</p>
<p>By this time I was trembling with the shock of a terror that was
entirely new to me. I could not explain to myself the nature of it,
but it was there, and I could not escape from it.</p>
<p>Hitherto, when I had thought of my marriage to Lord Raa I had
been troubled by the absence of love between us; and what I meant
to myself by love&mdash;the love of husband and wife&mdash;was the
kind of feeling I had for the Reverend Mother, heightened and
deepened and spiritualised, as I believed, by the fact (with all
its mysterious significance) that the one was a man and the other a
woman.</p>
<p>But this was something quite different. Not having found in
marriage what I had expected, I was finding something else, for
there could be no mistaking my husband's meaning when he looked at
me with his passionate eyes and said, "Wait awhile!"</p>
<p>I saw what was before me, and in fear of it I found myself
wishing that something might happen to save me. I was so frightened
that if I could have escaped from the car I should have done so.
The only thing I could hope for was that we should arrive at
Blackwater too late for the steamer, or that the storm would
prevent it from sailing. What relief from my situation I should
find in that, beyond the delay of one day, one night (in which I
imagined I might be allowed to return home), I did not know. But
none the less on that account I began to watch the clouds with a
feverish interest.</p>
<p>They were wilder than ever now&mdash;rolling up from the
south-west in huge black whorls which enveloped the mountains and
engulfed the valleys. The wind, too, was howling at intervals like
a beast being slaughtered. It was terrible, but not so terrible as
the thing I was thinking of. I was afraid of the storm, and yet I
was fearfully, frightfully glad of it.</p>
<p>My husband, who, after my repulse, had dropped back into his own
corner of the car, was very angry. He talked again of our
"God-forsaken island," and the folly of living in it, said our
passage would be a long one in any case, and we might lose our
connection to London.</p>
<p>"Damnably inconvenient if we do. I've special reasons for being
there in the morning," he said.</p>
<p>At a sharp turn of the road the wind smote the car as with an
invisible wing. One of the windows was blown in, and to prevent the
rain from driving on to us my husband had to hold up a cushion in
the gap.</p>
<p>This occupied him until we ran into Blackwater, and then he
dropped the cushion and put his head out, although the rain was
falling heavily, to catch the first glimpse of the water in the
bay.</p>
<p>It was in terrific turmoil. My heart leapt up at the sight of
it. My husband swore.</p>
<p>We drew up on the drenched and naked pier. My husband's valet,
in waterproofs, came to the sheltered side of the car, and,
shouting above the noises of the wind in the rigging of the
steamer, he said:</p>
<p>"Captain will not sail to-day, my lord. Inshore wind. Says he
couldn't get safely out of the harbour."</p>
<p>My husband swore violently. I was unused to oaths at that time
and they cut me like whipcord, but all the same my pulse was
bounding joyfully.</p>
<p>"Bad luck, my lord, but only one thing to do now," shouted the
valet.</p>
<p>"What's that?" said my husband, growling.</p>
<p>"Sleep in Blackwater to-night, in hopes of weather mending in
the morning."</p>
<p>Anticipating this course, he had already engaged rooms for us at
the "Fort George."</p>
<p>My heart fell, and I waited for my husband's answer. I was
stifling.</p>
<p>"All right, Hobson. If it must be, it must," he answered.</p>
<p>I wanted to speak, but I did not know what to say. There seemed
to be nothing that I could say.</p>
<p>A quarter of an hour afterwards we arrived at the hotel, where
the proprietor, attended by the manageress and the waiters,
received us with rather familiar smiles.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THIRTY_FIFTH_CHAPTER" id=
"THIRTY_FIFTH_CHAPTER"></a>THIRTY-FIFTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>When I began to write I determined to tell the truth and the
whole truth. But now I find that the whole truth will require that
I should invade some of the most sacred intimacies of human
experience. At this moment I feel as if I were on the threshold of
one of the sanctuaries of a woman's life, and I ask myself if it is
necessary and inevitable that I should enter it.</p>
<p>I have concluded that it <i>is</i> necessary and
inevitable&mdash;necessary to the sequence of my narrative,
inevitable for the motive with which I am writing it.</p>
<p>Four times already I have written what is to follow. In the
first case I found that I had said too much. In the second I had
said too little. In the third I was startled and shocked by the
portrait I had presented of myself and could not believe it to be
true. In the fourth I saw with a thrill of the heart that the
portrait was not only true, but too true. Let me try again.</p>
<p>I entered our rooms at the hotel, my husband's room and mine,
with a sense of fear, almost of shame. My sensations at that moment
had nothing in common with the warm flood of feeling which comes to
a woman when she finds herself alone for the first time with the
man she loves, in a little room which holds everything that is of
any account to her in the world. They were rather those of a young
girl who, walking with a candle through the dark corridors of an
empty house at night, is suddenly confronted by a strange face. I
was the young girl with the candle; the strange face was my
husband's.</p>
<p>We had three rooms, all communicating, a sitting-room in the
middle with bedrooms right and left. The bedroom on the right was
large and it contained a huge bed with a covered top and
tail-boards. That on the left was small, and it had a plain brass
and iron bedstead, which had evidently been meant for a lady's
maid. I had no maid yet. It was intended that I should engage a
French one in London.</p>
<p>Almost immediately on entering the sitting-room my husband, who
had not yet recovered from his disappointment, left me to go
downstairs, saying with something like a growl that he had
telegrams to send to London and instructions to give to his man
Hobson.</p>
<p>Without taking off my outer things I stepped up to the windows,
which were encrusted with salt from the flying spray. The hotel
stood on a rocky ledge above the harbour, and the sound of the sea,
beating on the outer side of the pier, came up with a deafening
roar. The red-funnelled steamer we should have sailed by lay on the
pier's sheltered side, letting down steam, swaying to her creaking
hawsers, and heaving to the foam that was surging against her
bow.</p>
<p>I was so nervous, so flurried, so preoccupied by vague fears
that I hardly saw or heard anything. Porters came up with our
trunks and asked me where they were to place them, but I scarcely
know how I answered them, although I was aware that
everything&mdash;both my husband's luggage and mine&mdash;was being
taken into the large bedroom. A maid asked if she ought to put a
light to the fire, and I said "Yes . . . no . . . yes," and
presently I heard the fire crackling.</p>
<p>After awhile my husband came back in a better temper and
said:</p>
<p>"Confounded nuisance, but I suppose we must make the best of
it."</p>
<p>He laughed as he said this, and coming closer and looking me
over with a smile which was at the same time passionate and proud,
he whispered:</p>
<p>"Dare say we'll not find the time long until to-morrow morning.
What do <i>you</i> think, my little beauty?"</p>
<p>Something in his voice rather than in his question made my heart
beat, and I could feel my face growing hot.</p>
<p>"Not taken off your things yet?" he said. "Come, let me help
you."</p>
<p>I drew out my hat-pins and removed my hat. At the same moment my
husband removed my sables and cloak, and as he did so he put his
arms about me, and held me close to him.</p>
<p>I shuddered. I tried not to, but I could not help it. My husband
laughed again, and said:</p>
<p>"Not got over it yet, little woman? Perhaps that's only because
you are not quite used to me."</p>
<p>Still laughing he pulled me still closer to him, and putting one
of his hands under my chin he kissed me on the mouth.</p>
<p>It will be difficult and perhaps it will be ridiculous to say
how my husband's first kiss shocked me. My mouth felt parched, I
had a sense of intense disgust, and before I was quite aware of
what I was doing I had put up both hands to push him off.</p>
<p>"Come, come, this is going too far," he said, in a tone that was
half playful, half serious. "It was all very well in the
automobile; but here, in your own rooms, you know. . . ."</p>
<p>He broke off and laughed again, saying that if my modesty only
meant that nobody had ever kissed me before it made me all the more
charming for him.</p>
<p>I could not help feeling a little ashamed of my embarrassment,
and crossing in front of my husband I seated myself in a chair
before the fire. He looked after me with a smile that made my heart
tremble, and then, coming behind my chair, he put his arms about my
shoulders and kissed my neck.</p>
<p>A shiver ran through me. I felt as if I had suffered a kind of
indecency. I got up and changed my place. My husband watched me
with the look of a man who wanted to roar with laughter. It was the
proud and insolent as well as passionate look of one who had never
so much as contemplated resistance.</p>
<p>"Well, this is funny," he said. "But we'll see presently! We'll
see!"</p>
<p>A waiter came in for orders, and early as it was my husband
asked for dinner to be served immediately. My heart was fluttering
excitedly by this time and I was glad of the relief which the
presence of other people gave me.</p>
<p>While the table was being laid my husband talked of the doings
of the day. He asked who was "the seedy old priest" who had given
us "the sermon" at the wedding breakfast&mdash;he had evidently
forgotten that he had seen the Father before.</p>
<p>I told him the "seedy old priest" was Father Dan, and he was a
saint if ever there was one.</p>
<p>"A saint, is he?" said my husband. "Wish saint were not
synonymous with simpleton, though."</p>
<p>Then he gave me his own views of "the holy state of matrimony."
By holding people together who ought to be apart it often caused
more misery and degradation of character than a dozen entirely
natural adulteries and desertions, which a man had sometimes to
repair by marriage or else allow himself to be regarded as a
seducer and a scoundrel.</p>
<p>I do not think my husband was conscious of the naive coarseness
of all this, as spoken to a young girl who had only just become his
wife. I am sure he was not aware that he was betraying himself to
me in every word he uttered and making the repugnance I had begun
to feel for him deepen into horror.</p>
<p>My palms became moist, and again and again I had to dry them
with my handkerchief. I was feeling more frightened and more
ashamed than I had ever felt before, but nevertheless when we sat
down to dinner I tried to compose myself. Partly for the sake of
appearance before the servants, and partly because I was taking
myself to task for the repugnance I felt towards my husband, I
found something to say, though my voice shook.</p>
<p>My husband ate ravenously and drank a good deal. Once or twice,
when he insisted on pouring out champagne for me, I clinked glasses
with him. Although every moment at table was increasing my fear and
disgust, I sometimes allowed myself to laugh.</p>
<p>Encouraged by this he renewed his endearments even before the
waiters had left the room, and when they had gone, with orders not
to return until he rang, and the door was closed behind them, he
switched off the lights, pushed a sofa in front of the fire, put me
to sit on it, sat down beside me and redoubled his tenderness.</p>
<p>"How's my demure little nun now?" he said. "Frightened, wasn't
she? They're all frightened at first, bless them!"</p>
<p>I could smell the liquor he had been drinking. I could see by
the firelight the prominent front tooth (partly hidden by his
moustache) which I had noticed when I saw him first, and the down
of soft hair which grew as low on his hands as his knuckles. Above
all I thought I could feel the atmosphere of other women about
him&mdash;loose women, bad women as it seemed to me&mdash;and my
fear and disgust began to be mixed with a kind of physical
horror.</p>
<p>For a little while I tried to fight against this feeling, but
when he began to put his arms about me, calling me by endearing
names, complaining of my coldness, telling me not to be afraid of
him, reminding me that I belonged to him now, and must do as he
wished, a faintness came over me, I trembled from head to foot and
made some effort to rise.</p>
<p>"Let me go," I said.</p>
<p>"Nonsense," he said, laughing and holding me to my seat. "You
bewitching little woman! You're only teasing me. How they love to
tease, these charming little women!"</p>
<p>The pupils of his eyes were glistening. I closed my own eyes in
order to avoid his look. At the next moment I felt his hand stray
down my body and in a fury of indignation I broke out of his arms
and leapt to my feet.</p>
<p>When I recovered my self-possession I was again looking out of
the window, and my husband, who was behind me, was saying in a tone
of anger and annoyance:</p>
<p>"What's the matter with you? I can't understand. What have I
done? Good heavens, we are man and wife, aren't we?"</p>
<p>I made no answer. My heart which had been hot with rage was
becoming cold with dread. It seemed to me that I had suffered an
outrage on my natural modesty as a human being, a sort of offence
against my dignity as a woman.</p>
<p>It was now dark. With my face to the window I could see nothing.
The rain was beating against the glass. The sea was booming on the
rocks. I wanted to fly, but I felt caged&mdash;morally and
physically caged.</p>
<p>My husband had lit a cigarette and was walking up and down the
sitting-room, apparently trying to think things out. After awhile
he approached me, out his hand on my shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"I see how it is. You're tired, and no wonder. You've had a long
and exhausting day. Better go to bed. We'll have to be up
early."</p>
<p>Glad to escape from his presence I allowed him to lead me to the
large bedroom. As I was crossing the threshold he told me to
undress and get into bed, and after that he said something about
waiting. Then he closed the door softly and I was alone.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THIRTY_SIXTH_CHAPTER" id=
"THIRTY_SIXTH_CHAPTER"></a>THIRTY-SIXTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>There was a fire in the bedroom and I sat down in front of it.
Many forces were warring within me. I was trying to fix my thoughts
and found it difficult to do so.</p>
<p>Some time passed. My husband's man came in with the noiseless
step of all such persons, opened one of the portmanteaux and laid
out his master's combs and brushes on the dressing table and his
sleeping suit on the bed. A maid of the hotel followed him, and
taking my own sleeping things out of the top tray of my trunk she
laid them out beside my husband's.</p>
<p>"Good-night, my lady," they said in their low voices as they
went out on tiptoe.</p>
<p>I hardly heard them. My mind, at first numb, was now going at
lightning speed. Brought face to face for the first time with one
of the greatest facts of a woman's life I was asking myself why I
had not reckoned with it before.</p>
<p>I had not even thought of it. My whole soul had been so much
occupied with one great spiritual issue&mdash;that I did not love
my husband (as I understood love), that my husband did not love
me&mdash;that I had never once plainly confronted, even in my own
mind, the physical fact that is the first condition of matrimony,
and nobody had mentioned it to me or even hinted at it.</p>
<p>I could not plead that I did not know of this condition. I was
young but I was not a child. I had been brought up in a convent,
but a convent is not a nursery. Then why had I not thought of
it?</p>
<p>While sitting before the fire, gathering together these dark
thoughts, I was in such fear that I was always conscious of my
husband's movements in the adjoining room. At one moment there was
the jingling of his glass against the decanter, at another moment
the smell of his cigarette smoke. From time to time he came to the
door and called to me in a sort of husky whisper, asking if I was
in bed.</p>
<p>"Don't keep me long, little girl."</p>
<p>I shuddered but made no reply.</p>
<p>At last he knocked softly and said he was coming in. I was still
crouching over the fire as he came up behind me.</p>
<p>"Not in bed yet?" he said. "Then I must put you to bed."</p>
<p>Before I could prevent him he had lifted me in his arms,
dragged me on to his knee and was pulling down my hair, laughing as
he did so, calling me by coarse endearing names and telling me not
to fight and struggle.</p>
<p>But the next thing I knew I was back in the sitting-room, where
I had switched up the lights, and my husband, whose face was
distorted by passion, was blazing out at me.</p>
<p>"What do you mean?" he said. "I'm your husband, am I not? You
are my wife, aren't you? What did you marry for? Good heavens, can
it be possible that you don't know what the conditions of matrimony
are? Is that what comes of being brought up in a convent? But has
your father allowed you to marry without. . . . And your
Aunt&mdash;what in God's name has the woman been doing?"</p>
<p>I crossed towards the smaller bedroom intending to enter it, but
my husband intercepted me.</p>
<p>"Don't be a fool," he said, catching at my wrist. "Think of the
servants. Think what they'd say. Think what the whole island would
say. Do you want to make a laughing stock of both of us?"</p>
<p>I returned and sat by the table. My husband lit another
cigarette. Nervously flicking the ends off with the index finger of
his left hand, and speaking quickly, as if the words scorched his
lips, he told me I was mistaken if I supposed that he wanted a
scene like this. He thought he could spend his time better. I was
equally mistaken if I imagined that he had desired our marriage at
all. Something quite different might have happened if he could have
afforded to please himself.</p>
<p>He had made sacrifices to marry me, too. Perhaps I had not
thought of that, but did I suppose a man of his class wanted a
person like my father for his father-in-law. And then my Aunt and
my cousins&mdash;ugh!</p>
<p>The Bishop, too! Was it nothing that a man had been compelled to
make all those ridiculous declarations? Children to be brought up
Catholics! Wife not to be influenced! Even to keep an open mind
himself to all the muss and mummery of the Church!</p>
<p>It wasn't over either. That seedy old "saint" was probably my
confessor. Did any rational man want another man to come between
him and his wife&mdash;knowing all he did and said, and everything
about him?</p>
<p>I was heart-sick as I listened to all this. Apparently the moral
of it was that if I had been allowed to marry without being
instructed in the first conditions of married life my husband had
suffered a gross and shocking injustice.</p>
<p>The disgust I felt was choking me. It was horribly humiliating
and degrading to see my marriage from my husband's point of view,
and when I remembered that I was bound fast to the man who talked
to me like this, and that he could claim rights in me, to-night,
to-morrow, as long as I lived, until death parted us, a wild
impulse of impotent anger at everybody and everything made me drop
my head on to the table and burst into tears.</p>
<p>My husband misunderstood this, as he misunderstood everything.
Taking my crying for the last remnant of my resistance he put his
arms round my shoulders again and renewed his fondling.</p>
<p>"Come, don't let us have any more conjugal scenes," he said.
"The people of the hotel will hear us presently, and there will be
all sorts of ridiculous rumours. If your family are rather common
people you are a different pair of shoes altogether."</p>
<p>He was laughing again, kissing my neck (in spite of my
shuddering) and saying:</p>
<p>"You really please me very much, you do indeed, and if they've
kept you in ignorance, what matter? Come now, my sweet little
woman, we'll soon repair that."</p>
<p>I could bear no more. I <i>must</i> speak and I did. Leaping up
and facing round on him I told him my side of the story&mdash;how I
had been married against my will, and had not wanted him any more
than he had wanted me; how all my objections had been overruled,
all my compunctions borne down; how everybody had been in a
conspiracy to compel me, and I had been bought and sold like a
slave.</p>
<p>"But you can't go any farther than that," I said. "Between you,
you have forced me to marry you, but nobody can force me to obey
you, because I won't."</p>
<p>I saw his face grow paler and paler as I spoke, and when I had
finished it was ashen-white.</p>
<p>"So that's how it is, is it?" he said, and for some minutes more
he tramped about the room, muttering inaudible words, as if trying
to account to himself for my conduct. At length he approached me
again and said, in the tone of one who thought he was making
peace:</p>
<p>"Look here, Mary. I think I understand you at last. You have
some other attachment&mdash;that's it, I suppose. Oh, don't think
I'm blaming you. I may be in the same case myself for all you know
to the contrary. But circumstances have been too strong for us and
here we are. Well, we're in it, and we've got to make the best of
it and why shouldn't we? Lots of people in my class are in the same
position, and yet they get along all right. Why can't we do the
same? I'll not be too particular. Neither will you. For the rest of
our lives let each of us go his and her own way. But that's no
reason why we should be strangers exactly. Not on our wedding-day
at all events. You're a damned pretty woman and I'm. . . . Well,
I'm not an ogre, I suppose. We are man and wife, too. So look here,
we won't expect too much affection from each other&mdash;but let's
stop this fooling and be good friends for a little while anyway.
Come, now."</p>
<p>Once more he took hold of me, as if to draw me back, kissing my
hands as he did so, but his gross misinterpretation of my
resistance and the immoral position he was putting me into were
stifling me, and I cried:</p>
<p>"No, I will not. Don't you see that I hate and loathe you?"</p>
<p>There could be no mistaking me this time. The truth had fallen
on my husband with a shock. I think it was the last thing his pride
had expected. His face became shockingly distorted. But after a
moment, recovering himself with a cruel laugh that made my hot
blood run cold, he said:</p>
<p>"Nevertheless, you shall do as I wish. You are my wife, and as
such you belong to me. The law allows me to compel you and I
will."</p>
<p>The words went shrieking through and through me. He was coming
towards me with outstretched arms, his teeth set, and his pupils
fixed. In the drunkenness of his rage he was laughing brutally.</p>
<p>But all my fear had left me. I felt an almost murderous impulse.
I wanted to strike him on the face.</p>
<p>"If you attempt to touch me I will throw myself out of the
window," I said.</p>
<p>"No fear of that," he said, catching me quickly in his arms.</p>
<p>"If you do not take your hands off me I'll shriek the house
down," I cried.</p>
<p>That was enough. He let me go and dropped back from me. At the
next moment I was breathing with a sense of freedom. Without
resistance on my husband's part I entered the little bedroom to the
left and locked the door behind me.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THIRTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"THIRTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER"></a>THIRTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Some further time passed. I sat by the fireless grate with my
chin in my hand. If the storm outside was still raging I did not
hear it. I was listening to the confused sounds that came from the
sitting-room.</p>
<p>My husband was pacing to and fro, muttering oaths, knocking
against the furniture, breaking things. At one moment there was a
crash of glass, as if he had helped himself to brandy and then in
his ungovernable passion flung the decanter into the fire
grate.</p>
<p>Somebody knocked at the sitting-room. It must have been a
waiter, for through the wall I heard the muffled sound of a voice
asking if there had been an accident. My husband swore at the man
and sent him off. Hadn't he told him not to come until he was rung
for?</p>
<p>At length, after half an hour perhaps, my husband knocked at the
door of my little room.</p>
<p>"Are you there?" he asked.</p>
<p>I made no answer.</p>
<p>"Open the door."</p>
<p>I sat motionless.</p>
<p>"You needn't be afraid. I'm not going to do anything. I've
something to say."</p>
<p>Still I made no reply. My husband went away for a moment and
then came back.</p>
<p>"If you are determined not to open the door I must say what I've
got to say from here. Are you listening?"</p>
<p>Sitting painfully rigid I answered that I was.</p>
<p>Then he told me that what I was doing would entitle him to annul
our marriage&mdash;in the eyes of the Church at all events.</p>
<p>If he thought that threat would intimidate me he was
mistaken&mdash;a wave of secret joy coursed through me.</p>
<p>"It won't matter much to me&mdash;I'll take care it
won't&mdash;but it will be a degrading business for
you&mdash;invalidity and all that. Are you prepared for it?"</p>
<p>I continued to sit silent and motionless.</p>
<p>"I daresay we shall both be laughed at, but I cannot help that.
We can't possibly live together on terms like these."</p>
<p>Another wave of joy coursed through me.</p>
<p>"Anyhow I intend to know before I leave the island how things
are to be. I'm not going to take you away until I get some
satisfaction. You understand?"</p>
<p>I listened, almost without breathing, but I did not reply.</p>
<p>"I'm think of writing a letter to your father, and sending
Hobson with it in the car immediately. Do you hear me?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Well, you know what your father is. Unless I'm much mistaken
he's not a man to have much patience with your semi-romantic,
semi-religious sentiments. Are you quite satisfied?"</p>
<p>"Quite."</p>
<p>"Very well! That's what I'll do, then."</p>
<p>After this there was a period of quiet in which I assumed that
my husband was writing his letter. Then I heard a bell ring
somewhere in the corridor, and shortly afterwards there was a
second voice in the sitting-room, but I could not hear the words
that were spoken. I suppose it was Hobson's low voice, for after
another short interval of silence there came the thrum and throb of
a motor-car and the rumble of india-rubber wheels on the wet gravel
of the courtyard in front of the hotel.</p>
<p>Then my husband knocked at my door again.</p>
<p>"I've written that letter and Hobson is waiting to take it. Your
father will probably get it before he goes to bed. It will be a bad
break on the festivities he was preparing for the village people.
But you are still of the same mind, I suppose?"</p>
<p>I did not speak, but I rose and went over to the window. For
some reason difficult to explain, that reference to the festivities
had cut me to the quick.</p>
<p>My husband must have been fuming at my apparent indifference,
and I felt as if I could see him looking at me, passionate and
proud.</p>
<p>"Between the lot of you I think you've done me a great
injustice. Have you nothing to say?"</p>
<p>Even then I did not answer.</p>
<p>"All right! As you please."</p>
<p>A few minutes afterwards I heard the motor-car turning and
driving away.</p>
<p>The wind had fallen, the waves were rolling into the harbour
with that monotonous moan which is the sea's memory of a storm, and
a full moon, like a white-robed queen, was riding through a
troubled sky.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THIRTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER" id=
"THIRTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER"></a>THIRTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>The moon had died out; a new day had dawned; the sea was lying
as quiet as a sleeping child; far out on the level horizon the sky
was crimsoning before the rising sun, and clouds of white sea-gulls
were swirling and jabbering above the rocks in the harbour below
the house before I lay down to sleep.</p>
<p>I was awakened by a hurried knocking at my door, and by an
impatient voice crying:</p>
<p>"Mary! Mary! Get up! Let me in!"</p>
<p>It was Aunt Bridget who had arrived in my husband's automobile.
When I opened the door to her she came sailing into the room with
her new half-moon bonnet a little awry, as if she had put it on
hurriedly in the dim light of early morning, and, looking at me
with her cold grey eyes behind their gold-rimmed spectacles, she
began to bombard me with mingled ridicule and indignant
protest.</p>
<p>"Goodness me, girl, what's all this fuss about? You little
simpleton, tell me what has happened!"</p>
<p>She was laughing. I had hardly ever heard Aunt Bridget laugh
before. But her vexation soon got the better of her merriment.</p>
<p>"His lordship's letter arrived in the middle of the night and
nearly frightened us out of our senses. Your father was for coming
away straight, and it would have been worse for you if he had. But
I said: 'No, this is work for a woman, I'll go,' and here I am. And
now tell me, what in the name of goodness does this ridiculous
trouble mean?"</p>
<p>It was hard to say anything on such a subject under such
circumstances, especially when so challenged, but Aunt Bridget,
without waiting for my reply, proceeded to indicate the substance
of my husband's letter.</p>
<p>From this I gathered that he had chosen (probably to save his
pride) to set down my resistance to ignorance of the first
conditions of matrimony, and had charged my father first and Aunt
Bridget afterwards with doing him a shocking injustice in
permitting me to be married to him without telling me what every
girl who becomes a wife ought to know.</p>
<p>"But, good gracious," said my Aunt Bridget, "who would have
imagined you <i>didn't</i> know. I thought every girl in the world
knew before she put up her hair and came out of short frocks. My
Betsy did, I'm sure of that. And to think that you&mdash;you whom
we thought so cute, so cunning. . . . Mary O'Neill, I'm ashamed of
you. I really, really am! Why, you goose" (Aunt Bridget was again
trying to laugh), "how did you suppose the world went on?"</p>
<p>The coarse ridicule of what was supposed to be my maidenly
modesty cut me like a knife, but I could not permit myself to
explain, so my Aunt Bridget ran on talking.</p>
<p>"I see how it has been. It's the fault of that Reverend Mother
at the convent. What sort of a woman is she? Is she a woman at all,
I wonder, or only a piece of stucco that ought to be put up in a
church corner! To think she could have you nine years and never say
one word about. . . . Well, well! What has she been doing with you?
Talking about the mysteries, I suppose&mdash;prayers and retreats
and novenas, and the spiritual bridegroom and the rest of it, while
all the while. . . . But you must put the convent out of your head,
my girl. You are a married woman now. You've got to think of your
husband, and a husband isn't a spiritual bridegroom I can tell you.
He's flesh and blood, that's what a husband is, and you can't
expect <i>him</i> to spend his time talking about eternity and the
rosary. Not on his wedding-day, anyway."</p>
<p>I was hot in my absurd embarrassment, and I dare say my face was
scarlet, but Aunt Bridget showed me no mercy.</p>
<p>"The way you have behaved is too silly for anything. . . . It
really is. A husband's a husband, and a wife's a wife. The wife has
to obey her husband. Of course she has. Every wife has to. Some
don't like it. I can't say that I liked it very much myself. But to
think of anybody objecting. Why, it's shocking! Nobody ever heard
of such a thing."</p>
<p>I must have flushed up to my forehead, for I became conscious
that in my Aunt Bridget's eyes there had been a kind of indecency
in my conduct.</p>
<p>"But, come," she said, "we must be sensible. It's timidity,
that's what it is. I was a little timid myself when I was first
married, but I soon got over it. Once get over your timidity and
you will be all right. Sakes alive, yes, you'll be as happy as the
day is long, and before this time to-morrow you'll wonder what on
earth you made all this fuss about."</p>
<p>I tried to say that what she predicted could never be, because I
did not love my husband, and therefore . . . but my Aunt Bridget
broke in on me, saying:</p>
<p>"Mary O'Neill, don't be a fool. Your maiden days are over now,
and you ought to know what your husband will do if you
persist."</p>
<p>I jumped at the thought that she meant he would annul our
marriage, but that was not what she was thinking of.</p>
<p>"He'll find somebody else&mdash;that's what he'll do. Serve you
right, too. You'll only have yourself to blame for it. Perhaps you
think you'll be able to do the same, but you won't. Women can't.
He'll be happy enough, and you'll be the only one to suffer, so
don't make a fool of yourself. Accept the situation. You may not
like your husband too much. I can't say I liked the Colonel
particularly. He took snuff, and no woman in the world could keep
him in clean pocket handkerchiefs. But when a sensible person has
got something at stake, she puts up with things. And that's what
you must do. He who wants fresh eggs must raise his own chickens,
you know."</p>
<p>Aunt Bridget ran on for some time longer, telling me of my
father's anger, which was not a matter for much surprise, seeing
how he had built himself upon my marriage, and how he had expected
that I should have a child, a son, to carry on the family.</p>
<p>"Do you mean to disappoint him after all he has done for you? It
would be too silly, too stupid. You'd be the laughing-stock of the
whole island. So get up and get dressed and be ready and willing to
go with his lordship when he sails by this afternoon's
steamer."</p>
<p>"I can't," I said.</p>
<p>"You can't? You mean you won't?"</p>
<p>"Very well, Auntie, I won't."</p>
<p>At that Aunt Bridget stormed at me for several minutes, telling
me that if my stubborn determination not to leave the island with
my husband meant that I intended to return home she might inform me
at once that I was not wanted there and I need not come.</p>
<p>"I've enough on my hands in that house already, what with Betsy
unmarried, and your father doing nothing for her, and that nasty
Nessy MacLeod making up to him. You ungrateful minx! You are
ruining everything! After all I've done for you too! But no matter!
If you <i>will</i> make your bed I shall take care that you lie on
it."</p>
<p>With that, and the peak of her half-moon bonnet almost dancing
over her angry face, Aunt Bridget flounced out of my room.</p>
<p>Half an hour afterwards, when I went into the sitting-room, I
found my father's advocate, Mr. Curphy, waiting for me. He looked
down at me with an indulgent and significant smile, which brought
the colour rushing back to my face, put me to sit by his side,
touched my arm with one of his large white clammy hands, stroked
his long brown beard with the other, and then in the half-reproving
tone which a Sunday-school teacher might have used to a wayward
child, he began to tell me what the consequences would be if I
persisted in my present conduct.</p>
<p>They would be serious. The law was very clear on marital rights.
If a wife refused to live with her husband, except on a plea of
cruelty or something equally plausible, he could apply to the court
and compel her to do so; and if she declined, if she removed
herself from his abode, or having removed, refused to return, the
Court might punish her&mdash;it might even imprison her.</p>
<p>"So you see, the man is the top dog in a case like this, my
dear, and he can compel the woman to obey him."</p>
<p>"Do you mean," I said, "that he can use force to compel
her?"</p>
<p>"Reasonable force, yes. I think that's so. And quite right, too,
when you come to think of it. The woman has entered into a serious
contract, and it is the duty of the law to see that she fulfills
the conditions of it."</p>
<p>I remembered how little I had known of the conditions of the
contract I had entered into, but I was too heart-sick and ashamed
to say anything about that.</p>
<p>"Aw yes, that's so," said the advocate, "force, reasonable
force! You may say it puts a woman in a worse position as a wife
than she would be if she were a mistress. That's true, but it's the
law, and once a woman has married a man, the only escape from this
condition of submission is imprisonment."</p>
<p>"Then I would rather that&mdash;a thousand times rather," I
said, for I was hot with anger and indignation.</p>
<p>Again the advocate smiled indulgently, patted my arm, and
answered me as if I were a child.</p>
<p>"Tut, tut, my dear, tut, tut! You've made a marriage that is
founded on suitability of position, property and education, and
everything will come right by and by. Don't act on a fit of pique
or spleen, and so destroy your happiness, and that of everybody
about you. Think of your father. Remember what he has done to make
this marriage. I may tell you that he has paid forty thousand
pounds to discharge your husband's debts and undertaken
responsibility for an allowance of six thousand a year beside. Do
you want him to lose all that money?"</p>
<p>I was so sick with disgust at hearing this that I could not
speak, and the advocate, who, in his different way, was as dead to
my real feelings as my husband had been, went on to say:</p>
<p>"Come, be reasonable. You may have suffered some slight, some
indignity. No doubt you have. Your husband is proud and he has
peculiarities of temper which we have all to make allowances for.
But even if you could establish a charge of cruelty against him and
so secure a separation&mdash;which you can't&mdash;what good would
that do you? None at all&mdash;worse than none! The financial
arrangements would remain the same. Your father would be a
frightful loser. And what would you be? A married widow! The worst
condition in the world for a woman&mdash;especially if she is young
and attractive, and subject to temptations. Ask anybody who
knows&mdash;anybody."</p>
<p>I felt as if I would suffocate with shame.</p>
<p>"Come now," said the advocate in his superior way, taking my
hand as if he were going to lead me like a child to my husband,
"let us put an end to this little trouble. His lordship is
downstairs and he has consented&mdash;kindly and generously
consented&mdash;to wait an hour for your answer. But he must leave
the island by the afternoon steamer, and if. . . ."</p>
<p>"Then tell him he must leave it without me," I said, as well as
I could for the anger that was choking me.</p>
<p>The advocate looked steadily into my face. I think he understood
the situation at last.</p>
<p>"You mean that&mdash;really and truly mean it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"I do," I answered, and unable to say or hear any more without
breaking out on him altogether I left the room.</p>

<h2><a name="THIRTY_NINTH_CHAPTER" id=
"THIRTY_NINTH_CHAPTER"></a>THIRTY-NINTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Down to this moment I had put on a brave front though my very
heart had been trembling; but now I felt that all the weight of
law, custom, parental authority and even religion was bearing me
down, down, down, and unless help came I must submit in the long
run.</p>
<p>I was back in the small bedroom, with my hot forehead against
the cold glass of the window, looking out yet seeing nothing, when
somebody knocked at the door, softly almost timidly. It was Father
Dan, and the sight of his dear face, broken up with emotion, was
the same to me as the last plank of a foundering ship to a sailor
drowning at sea.</p>
<p>My heart was so full that, though I knew I ought not, I threw my
arms about his neck and burst into a flood of tears. The good old
priest did not put me away. He smoothed my drooping head and patted
my shoulders and in his sweet and simple way he tried to comfort
me.</p>
<p>"Don't cry! Don't worry! It will be all right in the end, my
child."</p>
<p>There was something almost grotesque in his appearance. Under
his soft clerical outdoor hat he was wearing his faded old cassock,
as if he had come away hurriedly at a sudden call. I could see what
had happened&mdash;my family had sent him to reprove me and
remonstrate with me.</p>
<p>He sat on a chair by my bed and I knelt on the floor at his
feet, just as my mother used to do when I was a child and she was
making her confession. Perhaps he thought of that at the same
moment as myself, for the golden light of my mother's memory lay
always about him. For some moments we did not speak. I think we
were both weeping.</p>
<p>At length I tried to tell him what had happened&mdash;hiding
nothing, softening nothing, speaking the simple and naked truth. I
found it impossible to do so. My odd-sounding voice was not like my
own, and even my words seemed to be somebody else's. But Father Dan
understood everything.</p>
<p>"I know! I know!" he said, and then, to my great relief,
interrupting my halting explanations, he gave his own
interpretation of my husband's letter.</p>
<p>There was a higher love and there was a lower love and both were
necessary to God's plans and purposes. But the higher love must
come first, or else the lower one would seem to be cruel and gross
and against nature.</p>
<p>Nature was kind to a young girl. Left to itself it awakened her
sex very gently. First with love, which came to her like a whisper
in a dream, like the touch of an angel on her sleeping eyelids, so
that when she awoke to the laws of life the mysteries of sex did
not startle or appal her.</p>
<p>But sex in me had been awakened rudely and ruthlessly. Married
without love I had been suddenly confronted by the lower passion.
What wonder that I had found it brutal and barbarous?</p>
<p>"That's it, my child! That's it! I know! I know!"</p>
<p>Then he began to blame himself for everything, saying it was all
his fault and that he should have held out longer. When he saw how
things stood between me and my husband he should have said to my
father, to the Bishop, and to the lawyers, notwithstanding all
their bargainings: "This marriage must not go on. It will lead to
disaster. It begins to end badly."</p>
<p>"But now it is all over, my child, and there's no help for
it."</p>
<p>I think the real strength of my resistance to Aunt Bridget's
coarse ridicule and the advocate's callous remonstrance must have
been the memory of my husband's threat when he talked about the
possible annulment of our marriage. The thought of that came back
to me now, and half afraid, half ashamed, with a fluttering of the
heart, I tried to mention it.</p>
<p>"Is there no way out?" I asked.</p>
<p>"What way can there be?" said Father Dan. "God knows I know what
pressure was put upon you; but you are married, you have made your
vows, you have given your promises. That's all the world sees or
cares about, and in the eyes of the law and the Church you are
responsible for all that has happened."</p>
<p>With my head still buried in Father Dan's cassock I got it out
at last.</p>
<p>"But annulment! Isn't that possible&mdash;under the
circumstances?" I asked.</p>
<p>The good old priest seemed to be too confused to speak for a
moment. Then he explained that what I hoped for was quite out of
the question.</p>
<p>"I don't say that in the history of the Church marriages have
not been annulled on equally uncertain grounds, but in this case
the civil law would require proof&mdash;something to justify
nullity. Failing that there would have to be collusion either on
one side or both, and that is not possible&mdash;not to you, my
child, not to the daughter of your mother, that dear saint who
suffered so long and was silent."</p>
<p>More than ever now I felt like a ship-broken man with the last
plank sinking under him. The cold mysterious dread of my husband
was creeping back, and the future of my life with him stood before
me with startling vividness. In spite of all my struggling and
fighting of the night before I saw myself that very night, the next
night, and the next, and every night and day of my life thereafter,
a victim of the same sickening terror.</p>
<p>"Must I submit, then?" I said.</p>
<p>Father Dan smoothed my head and told me in his soft voice that
submission was the lot of all women. It always had been so in the
history of the world, and perhaps it always would be.</p>
<p>"Remember the Epistle we read in church yesterday morning:
'Wives submit yourselves to your husbands.'"</p>
<p>With a choking sensation in my throat I asked if he thought I
ought to go away with my husband when he left the island by the
afternoon steamer.</p>
<p>"I see no escape from it, my poor child. They sent me to reprove
you. I can't do that, but neither can I encourage you to resist. It
would be wrong. It would be cruel. It would only lead you into
further trouble."</p>
<p>My mouth felt parched, but I contrived to say:</p>
<p>"Then you can hold out no hope for me?"</p>
<p>"God knows I can't."</p>
<p>"Although I do not love this man I must live with him as his
wife?"</p>
<p>"It is hard, very hard, but there seems to be no help for
it."</p>
<p>I rose to my feet, and went back to the window. A wild impulse
of rebellion was coming over me.</p>
<p>"I shall feel like a bad woman," I said.</p>
<p>"Don't say that," said Father Dan. "You are married to the man
anyway."</p>
<p>"All the same I shall feel like my husband's mistress&mdash;his
married mistress, his harlot."</p>
<p>Father Dan was shocked, and the moment the words were out of my
mouth I was more frightened than I had ever been before, for
something within seemed to have forced them out of me.</p>
<p>When I recovered possession of my senses Father Dan, nervously
fumbling with the silver cross that hung over his cassock, was
talking of the supernatural effect of the sacrament of marriage. It
was God Who joined people together, and whom God joined together no
man might put asunder. No circumstances either, no trial or
tribulation. Could it be thought that a bond so sacred, so
indissoluble, was ever made without good effect? No, the Almighty
had His own ways with His children, and this great mystery of holy
wedlock was one of them.</p>
<p>"So don't lose heart, my child. Who knows what may happen yet?
God works miracles now just as He did in the old days. You may come
. . . yes, you may come to love your husband, and then&mdash;then
all will be well."</p>
<p>Suddenly out of my despair and my defiance a new thought came to
me. It came with the memory of the emotion I had experienced during
the marriage service, and it thrilled me through and through.</p>
<p>"Father Dan?" I said, with a nervous cry, for my heart was
fluttering again.</p>
<p>"What is it, my child?"</p>
<p>It was hard to say what I was thinking about, but with a great
effort I stammered it out at last. I should be willing to leave the
island with my husband, and live under the same roof with him, and
bear his name, so that there might be no trouble, or scandal, and
nobody except ourselves might ever know that there was anything
dividing us, any difference of any kind between us, if he, on his
part, would promise&mdash;firmly and faithfully promise&mdash;that
unless and until I came to love him he would never claim my
submission as a wife.</p>
<p>While I spoke I hardly dared to look at Father Dan, fearing he
would shake his head again, perhaps reprove me, perhaps laugh at
me. But his eyes which had been moist began to sparkle and
smile.</p>
<p>"You mean that?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And you will go away with him on that condition?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes."</p>
<p>"Then he must agree to it."</p>
<p>The pure-minded old priest saw no difficulties, no dangers, no
risks of breakdown in my girlish scheme. Already my husband had got
all he had bargained for. He had got my father's money in exchange
for his noble name, and if he wanted more, if he wanted the love of
his wife, let him earn it, let him win it.</p>
<p>"That's only right, only fair. It will be worth winning,
too&mdash;better worth winning than all your father's gold and
silver ten times over. I can tell him that much anyway."</p>
<p>He had risen to his feet in his excitement, the simple old
priest with his pure heart and his beautiful faith in me.</p>
<p>"And you, my child, you'll try to love him in
return&mdash;promise you will."</p>
<p>A shiver ran through me when Father Dan said that&mdash;a sense
of the repugnance I felt for my husband almost stifled me.</p>
<p>"Promise me," said Father Dan, and though my face must have been
scarlet, I promised him.</p>
<p>"That's right. That alone will make him a better man. He may be
all that people say, but who can measure the miraculous influence
of a good woman?"</p>
<p>He was making for the door.</p>
<p>"I must go downstairs now and speak to your husband. But he'll
agree. Why shouldn't he? I know he's afraid of a public scandal,
and if he attempts to refuse I'll tell him that. . . . But no, that
will be quite unnecessary. Good-bye, my child! If I don't come back
you'll know that everything has been settled satisfactorily. You'll
be happy yet. I'm sure you will. Ah, what did I say about the
mysterious power of that solemn and sacred sacrament?
Good-bye!"</p>
<p>I meant what I had said. I meant to do what I had promised. God
knows I did. But does a woman ever know her own heart? Or is heaven
alone the judge of it?</p>
<p>At four o'clock that afternoon my husband left Ellan for
England. I went with him.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FORTIETH_CHAPTER" id="FORTIETH_CHAPTER"></a>FORTIETH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Having made my bargain I set myself to fulfil the conditions of
it. I had faithfully promised to try to love my husband and I
prepared to do so.</p>
<p>Did not love require that a wife should look up to and respect
and even reverence the man she had married? I made up my mind to do
that by shutting my eyes to my husband's obvious faults and seeing
only his better qualities.</p>
<p>What disappointments were in store for me! What crushing and
humiliating disillusionments!</p>
<p>On the night of our arrival in London we put up at a fashionable
hotel in a quiet but well-known part of the West-end, which is
inhabited chiefly by consulting physicians and celebrated surgeons.
Here, to my surprise, we were immediately discovered, and lines of
visitors waited upon my husband the following morning.</p>
<p>I thought they were his friends, and a ridiculous little spurt
of pride came to me from heaven knows where with the idea that my
husband must be a man of some importance in the metropolis.</p>
<p>But I discovered they were his creditors, money-lenders and
bookmakers, to whom he owed debts of "honour" which he had been
unable or unwilling to disclose to my father and his advocate.</p>
<p>One of my husband's visitors was a pertinacious little man who
came early and stayed late. He was a solicitor, and my husband was
obviously in some fear of him. The interviews between them, while
they were closeted together morning after morning in one of our two
sitting-rooms, were long and apparently unpleasant, for more than
once I caught the sound of angry words on both sides, with oaths
and heavy blows upon the table.</p>
<p>But towards the end of the week, my husband's lawyer arrived in
London, and after that the conversations became more pacific.</p>
<p>One morning, as I sat writing a letter in the adjoining room, I
heard laughter, the popping of corks, the jingling of glasses, and
the drinking of healths, and I judged that the, difficult and
disagreeable business had been concluded.</p>
<p>At the close of the interview I heard the door opened and my
husband going into the outer corridor to see his visitors to the
lift, and then something prompted me&mdash;God alone knows
what&mdash;to step into the room they had just vacated.</p>
<p>It was thick with tobacco smoke. An empty bottle of champagne
(with three empty wine glasses) was on the table, and on a desk by
the window were various papers, including a sheet of foolscap which
bore a seal and several signatures, and a thick packet of old
letters bound together with a piece of purple ribbon.</p>
<p>Hardly had I had time to recognise these documents when my
husband returned to the room, and by the dark expression of his
face I saw instantly that he thought I had looked at them.</p>
<p>"No matter!" he said, without any preamble. "I might as well
tell you at once and have done with it."</p>
<p>He told me. The letters were his. They had been written to a
woman whom he had promised to marry, and he had had to buy them
back from her. Although for three years he had spent a fortune on
the creature she had shown him no mercy. Through her solicitor, who
was a scoundrel, she had threatened him, saying in plain words that
if he married anybody else she would take proceedings against him
immediately. That was why, in spite of the storm, we had to come up
to London on the day after our wedding.</p>
<p>"Now you know," said my husband. "Look here" (holding out the
sheet of foolscap), "five thousand pounds&mdash;that's the price
I've had to pay for marrying."</p>
<p>I can give no idea of the proud imperiousness and the impression
of injury with which my husband told his brutal story. But neither
can I convey a sense of the crushing shame with which I listened to
it. There was not a hint of any consciousness on his part of my
side of the case. Not a suggestion of the clear fact that the woman
he had promised to marry had been paid off by money which had come
through me. Not a thought of the humiliation he had imposed upon
his wife in dragging her up to London at the demand of his cast-off
mistress.</p>
<p>When my husband had finished speaking I could not utter a word.
I was afraid that my voice would betray the anger that was boiling
in me. But I was also degraded to the very dust in my own eyes, and
to prevent an outburst of hysterical tears I ran back to my room
and hid my face in my pillow.</p>
<p>What was the good of trying to make myself in love with a man
who was separated from me by a moral chasm that could never be
passed? What was the good? What was the good?</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FORTY_FIRST_CHAPTER" id=
"FORTY_FIRST_CHAPTER"></a>FORTY-FIRST CHAPTER</h2>
<p>But next morning, having had time to think things out in my
simple and ignorant way, I tried to reconcile myself to my
position. Remembering what Aunt Bridget had said, both before my
marriage and after it, about the different moralities of men and
women, I told myself I had placed my standard too high.</p>
<p>Perhaps a husband was not a superior being, to be regarded with
respect and reverence, but a sort of grown-up child whom it was the
duty of a wife to comfort, coax, submit to and serve.</p>
<p>I determined to do this. Still clinging to the hope of falling
in love with my husband, I set myself to please him by every means
within my power, even to the length of simulating sentiments which
I did not feel.</p>
<p>But what a task I was setting myself! What a steep and stony
Calvary I was attempting to climb!</p>
<p>After the degrading business with the other woman had been
concluded I thought we should have left England immediately on the
honeymoon tour which my husband had mapped out for us, but he told
me that would not be convenient and we must remain in London a
little longer. We stayed six weeks altogether, and never did a
young wife pass a more cheerless and weary time.</p>
<p>I had no friends of my own within reach, and to my deep if
secret mortification no woman of my husband's circle called upon
me. But a few of his male friends were constantly with us,
including Mr. Eastcliff, who had speedily followed us from Ellan,
and a Mr. Vivian, who, though the brother of a Cabinet Minister,
seemed to me a very vain and vapid person, with the eyes of a mole,
a vacant smile, a stupid expression, an abrupt way of speaking
through his teeth, and a shrill voice which gave the impression of
screeching against the wind.</p>
<p>With these two men, and others of a similar kind, we passed many
hours of nearly every day, lunching with them, dining with them,
walking with them, driving with them, and above all playing bridge
with them in one of our sitting rooms in the hotel.</p>
<p>I knew nothing of the game to begin with, never having touched a
card in my life, but in accordance with the theories which I
believed to be right and the duties I had imposed upon myself, I
took a hand with my husband when he could find nobody better to be
his partner.</p>
<p>The results were very disheartening. In spite of my desire to
please I was slow to learn, and my husband's impatience with my
mistakes, which confused and intimidated me, led to some painful
humiliations. First he laughed, next he sneered, then he snapped me
up in the midst of my explanations and apologies, and finally, at a
moment of loss, he broke out on me with brutal derision, saying he
had never had much opinion of my intellect, but was now quite sure
that I had no more brains than a rabbit and could not say Boo to a
goose.</p>
<p>One day when we were alone, and he was lying on the couch with
his vicious little terrier by his side, I offered to sing to him.
Remembering how my voice had been praised, I thought it would be
pleasant to my husband to see that there was something I really
could do. But nine years in a convent had left me with next to no
music but memories of the long-breathed harmonies of some of the
beautiful masses of our Church, and hardly had I begun on these
when my husband cried:</p>
<p>"Oh, stop, stop, for heaven's sake stop, or I shall think we're
attending a funeral."</p>
<p>Another day I offered to read to him. The Reverend Mother used
to say I was the best reader she had ever heard, but perhaps it was
not altogether my husband's fault if he formed a different opinion.
And indeed I cannot but think that the holy saints themselves would
have laughed if they had heard me reading aloud, in the voice and
intonation which I had assumed for the meditations of St. Francis
of Assisi, the mystic allusions to "certs," and "bookies," and
"punters," and "evens," and "scratchings," which formed the
substance of the sporting journals that were my husband's only
literature.</p>
<p>"Oh, stop it, stop it," he cried again. "You read the 'Winning
Post' as if it were the Book of Revelation."</p>
<p>As time passed the gulf that separated me from my husband became
still greater. If I could have entertained him with any kind of
gossip we might have got on better. But I had no conversation that
interested him, and he had little or none that I could pretend to
understand. He loved the town; I loved the country; he loved the
night and the blaze of electric lights; I loved the morning and the
sweetness of the sun.</p>
<p>At the bottom of my heart I knew that his mind was common, low
and narrow, and that his tastes were gross and vulgar, but I was
determined to conquer the repulsion I felt for him.</p>
<p>It was impossible. If I could have struck one spark from the
flint of his heart the relations between us might have been
different. If his look could have met my look in a single glance of
understanding I could have borne with his impatience and struggled
on.</p>
<p>But nothing of this kind ever happened, and when one dreary
night after grumbling at the servants, cursing his fate and abusing
everybody and everything, he put on his hat and went out saying he
had "better have married Lena [the other woman] after all," for in
that case he would have had "some sort of society anyway," the
revulsion I had felt on the night of my marriage came sweeping over
me like a wave of the sea, and I asked myself again, "What's the
good? What's the good?"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FORTY_SECOND_CHAPTER" id=
"FORTY_SECOND_CHAPTER"></a>FORTY-SECOND CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Nevertheless next day I found myself taking my husband's side
against myself.</p>
<p>If he had sacrificed anything in order to marry me it was my
duty to make it up to him.</p>
<p>I resolved that I <i>should</i> make it up to him. I would study
my husband's likes and dislikes in every little thing. I would
share in his pleasures and enter into his life. I would show him
that a wife was something other and better than any hired woman in
the world, and that when she cast in her lot with her husband it
was for his own sake only and not for any fortune he could spend on
her.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, that's what I'll do," I thought, and I became more
solicitous of my husband's happiness than if I had really and truly
loved him.</p>
<p>A woman would smile at the efforts which I made in my
inexperience to make my husband forget his cast-off mistress, and
indeed some of them were very childish.</p>
<p>The first was a ridiculous failure.</p>
<p>My husband's birthday was approaching and I wished to make him a
present. It was difficult to know what to select, for I knew little
or nothing of his tastes or wants; but walking one day in a street
off Oxford Street I saw, in the window of a shop for the sale of
objects of ecclesiastical <i>vertu</i>, among crosses and
crucifixes and rosaries, a little ivory ink-stand and paper-holder,
which was surmounted by a figure of the Virgin.</p>
<p>I cannot for the life of me conceive why I thought this would be
a suitable present for my husband, except that the face of Our Lady
was so young, so sweet, so beautiful, and so exquisitely feminine
that it seemed impossible that any man in the world should not love
her. But however that might be I bought her, and carrying her home
in a cab, I set her on my husband's desk without a word, and then
stood by, like the mother of Moses, to watch the result.</p>
<p>There was no result&mdash;at first at all events. My husband was
several hours in the room with my treasure without appearing to be
aware of its presence. But towards evening his two principal
friends came to play bridge with him, and then, from the ambush of
my own apartments, I heard the screechy voice of Mr. Vivian
saying:</p>
<p>"Dash it all, Jimmy, you don't say you're going to be a
Pape?"</p>
<p>"Don't fret yourself, old fellow," replied my husband. "That's
my wife's little flutter. Dare say the poor fool has had to promise
her priest to make me a 'vert.'"</p>
<p>My next experiment was perhaps equally childish but certainly
more successful.</p>
<p>Seeing that my husband was fond of flowers, and was rarely
without a rose in his buttonhole, I conceived the idea of filling
his room with them in honour of his birthday. With this view I got
up very early, before anybody in the hotel was stirring, and
hurried off to Covent Garden, through the empty and echoing
streets, while the air of London was fresh with the breath of
morning and the big city within its high-built walls seemed to
dream of the green fields beyond.</p>
<p>I arrived at the busy and noisy square just as the waggons were
rolling in from the country with huge crates of red and white
roses, bright with the sunshine and sparkling with the dew. Then
buying the largest and loveliest and costliest bunch of them (a
great armful, as much as I could hold), I hurried back to the hotel
and set them in vases and glasses in every part of my husband's
room&mdash;his desk, his sideboard, his mantelpiece, and above all
his table, which a waiter was laying for breakfast&mdash;until the
whole place was like a bridal bower.</p>
<p>"Ah, this is something like," I heard my husband say as he came
out of his bedroom an hour or two afterwards with his vicious
terrier at his heels.</p>
<p>I heard no more until he had finished breakfast, and then, while
drawing on his gloves for his morning walk, he said to the waiter,
who was clearing the table,</p>
<p>"Tell your Manageress I am much obliged to her for the charming
flowers with which she has decorated my room this morning."</p>
<p>"But it wasn't the manageress, my lord," said the waiter.</p>
<p>"Then who was it?"</p>
<p>"It was her . . . her ladyship," said the waiter.</p>
<p>"O-oh!" said my husband in a softer, if more insinuating tone,
and a few minutes afterwards he went out whistling.</p>
<p>God knows that was small reward for the trouble I had taken, but
I was so uplifted by the success of my experiment that I determined
to go farther, and when towards evening of the same day a group of
my husband's friends came to tell him that they had booked a box at
a well-known musical comedy theatre, I begged to be permitted to
join them.</p>
<p>"Nonsense, my dear! Brompton Oratory would suit you better,"
said my husband, chucking me under the chin.</p>
<p>But I persisted in my importunities, and at length Mr. Eastcliff
said:</p>
<p>"Let her come. Why shouldn't she?"</p>
<p>"Very well," said my husband, pinching my cheek. "As you please.
But if you don't like it don't blame <i>me</i>."</p>
<p>It did not escape me that as a result of my change of front my
husband had risen in his own esteem, and that he was behaving
towards me as one who thought he had conquered my first repugnance,
or perhaps triumphantly ridden over it. But in my simplicity I was
so fixed in my determination to make my husband forget the loss of
his mistress that I had no fear of his familiarities and no
misgivings about his mistakes.</p>
<p>All that was to come later, with a fresh access of revulsion and
disgust.</p>

<h2><a name="FORTY_THIRD_CHAPTER" id=
"FORTY_THIRD_CHAPTER"></a>FORTY-THIRD CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I had seen enough of London by this time to know that the
dresses which had been made for me at home were by no means the
<i>mode</i>; but after I had put on the best-fitting of my simple
quaker-like costumes with a string of the family pearls about my
neck and another about my head, not all the teaching of the good
women of the convent could prevent me from thinking that my husband
and his friends would have no reason to be ashamed of me.</p>
<p>We were a party of six in all, whereof I was the only woman, and
we occupied a large box on the first tier near the stage, a
position of prominence which caused me a certain embarrassment,
when, as happened at one moment of indefinable misery, the opera
glasses of the people in the dress-circle and stalls were turned in
our direction.</p>
<p>I cannot say that the theatre impressed me. Certainly the
building itself did not do so, although it was beautifully
decorated in white and gold, for I had seen the churches of Rome,
and in my eyes they were much more gorgeous.</p>
<p>Neither did the audience impress me, for though I had never
before seen so many well-dressed people in one place, I thought too
many of the men, when past middle life, seemed fat and overfed, and
too many of the women, with their plump arms and bare shoulders,
looked as if they thought of nothing but what to eat and what to
put on.</p>
<p>Nor did the performers impress me, for though when the curtain
rose, disclosing the stage full of people, chiefly girls, in
delicate and beautiful toilettes, I thought I had never before seen
so many lovely and happy faces, after a while, when the faces fell
into repose, I thought they were not really lovely and not really
happy, but hard and strained and painful, as if life had been very
cruel.</p>
<p>And, above all, I was not impressed by the play, for I thought,
in my ignorance of such productions, that I had never heard
anything so frivolous and foolish, and more than once I found
myself wondering whether my good nuns, if they could have been
present, would not have concluded that the whole company had taken
leave of their senses.</p>
<p>There was, however, one thing which did impress me, and that was
the leading actor. It was a woman, and when she first came on to
the stage I thought I had never in my life seen anybody so
beautiful, with her lovely soft round figure, her black eyes, her
red lips, her pearly white teeth, and a smile so sunny that it had
the effect of making everybody in the audience smile with her.</p>
<p>But the strange thing was&mdash;I could not account for
it&mdash;that after a few minutes I thought her extremely ugly and
repellent, for her face seemed to be distorted by malice and envy
and hatred and nearly every other bad passion.</p>
<p>Nevertheless she was a general favourite, for not only was she
applauded before she did anything, but everything she said, though
it was sometimes very silly, was accompanied by a great deal of
laughter, and everything she sang, though her voice was no great
matter, was followed by a chorus of applause.</p>
<p>Seeing this, and feeling that her appearance had caused a
flutter of interest in the box behind me, I laughed and applauded
also, in accordance with the plan I had prepared for myself, of
sharing my husband's pleasures and entering into his life, although
at the bottom of my heart I really thought the joy was not very
joyful or the mirth very merry.</p>
<p>This went on for nearly an hour, and then a strange thing
happened. I was leaning forward on the velvet barrier of the box in
front of me, laughing and clapping my hands with the rest, when all
at once I became aware that the lady had wheeled about, and,
walking down the stage in the direction of our box, was looking
boldly back at me.</p>
<p>I could not at first believe it to be so, and even now I cannot
say whether it was something in her face, or something whispered at
my back which flashed it upon my mind that this was the woman my
husband ought to have married, the woman whose place I had taken,
the woman of the foolscap document and the letters in the purple
ribbon.</p>
<p>After that I could play my poor little part no longer, and
though I continued to lean on the yellow velvet of the barrier in
front of me I dropped my eyes as often as that woman was on the
stage, and hoped and prayed for the end of the performance.</p>
<p>It came at length with a crash of instruments and voices, and a
few minutes afterwards my husband and I were in the cab on our way
back to the hotel.</p>
<p>I was choking with mingled anger and shame&mdash;anger at my
husband for permitting me to come to a place in which I could be
exposed to a public affront from his cast-off mistress, shame at
the memory of the pitiful scheme for entering into his life which
had fallen to such a welter of wreck and ruin.</p>
<p>But my husband himself was only choking with laughter.</p>
<p>"It was as good as a play," he said. "Upon my soul it was! I
never saw anything funnier in the whole course of my life."</p>
<p>That served him, repeated again and again, until we reached the
hotel, when he ordered a bottle of wine to be sent upstairs, and
then shook with suppressed laughter as we went up in the lift.</p>
<p>Coming to our floor I turned towards my bedroom, wishing to be
alone with my outraged feelings, but my husband drew me into one of
our sitting-rooms, telling me he had something to say.</p>
<p>He put me to sit in an arm-chair, threw off his overcoat, lit a
cigarette, as well as he could for the spurts and gusts of his
laughter, and then, standing back to the fire-place, with one hand
in his pocket and his coat-tail over his arm, he told me the cause
of his merriment.</p>
<p>"I don't mind telling you that was Lena," he said. "The
good-looking girl in the scarlet dress and the big diamonds. She
spotted me the moment she stepped on to the stage. Must have
guessed who you were, too. Did you see how she looked at you?
Thought I had brought you there to walk over her. I'm sure she
did!"</p>
<p>There was another gust of laughter and then&mdash;</p>
<p>"She'd been going about saying I had married an old frump for
the sake of her fortune, and when she saw that you could wipe her
off the face of the earth without a gown that was worth wearing,
she was ready to die with fury."</p>
<p>There was another gust of laughter through the smoke that was
spurting from his mouth and then&mdash;</p>
<p>"And you, too, my dear! Laughing and applauding! She thought you
were trying to crow over her! On her own particular barn-door, too!
Upon my soul, it was too amusing. I wonder she didn't throw
something at you. She's like that when she's in her tantrums."</p>
<p>The waiter came in with the wine and my husband poured out a
glass for me.</p>
<p>"Have a drink. No? Well, here's to your health, my dear. I can't
get over it. I really can't. Lena's too funny for anything. Why,
what else do you think she's been saying? She's been saying I'll
come back to her yet. Yes, 'I'll give him six months to come
crawling back to me,' she said to Eastcliff and Vivian and some of
the other fellows at the Club. Wonder if she thinks so now? . . . I
wonder?"</p>
<p>He threw away his cigarette, drank another glass of the wine,
came close up to me and said in a lower tone, which made my skin
creep as with cold.</p>
<p>"Whether she's right or wrong depends on you, though."</p>
<p>"On me?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes, of course. That's only natural. One may have all the
goodwill in the world, but a man's a man, you know."</p>
<p>I felt my lips quivering with anger, and in an effort to control
myself I rose to go, but my husband drew me back into my chair and
sat on the arm of it.</p>
<p>"Don't go yet. By the way, dear, I've never thanked you for the
beautiful flowers with which you decorated my room this morning.
Charming! But I always knew you would soon come round to it."</p>
<p>"Come round to what?" I said, but it was just as if somebody
else were speaking.</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> know. Of course you know. When that simple old
priest proposed that ridiculous compact I agreed, but I knew quite
well that it would soon break down. Not on my side, though. Why
should it? A man can afford to wait. But I felt sure you would soon
tire of your resistance. And you have, haven't you? Oh, I'm not
blind. I've seen what's been going on, though I've said nothing
about it."</p>
<p>Again I tried to rise, and again my husband held me to my seat,
saying:</p>
<p>"Don't be ashamed. There's no reason for that. You were rather
hard on me, you know, but I'm going to forget all about it. Why
shouldn't I? I've got the loveliest little woman in the world, so I
mean to meet her half way, and she's going to get over her
convent-bred ideas and be my dear little darling wife. Now isn't
she?"</p>
<p>I could have died of confusion and the utter degradation of
shame. To think that my poor efforts to please him, my vain
attempts to look up to him and reverence him, my bankrupt appeals
to the spiritual woman in me that I might bring myself to love him,
as I thought it was my duty to do, should have been perverted by
his gross and vulgar mind into overtures to the animal man in
him&mdash;this was more than I could bear. I felt the tears gushing
to my eyes, but I kept them back, for my self-pity was not so
strong as my wrath.</p>
<p>I rose this time without being aware of his resistance.</p>
<p>"Let me go to bed," I said.</p>
<p>"Certainly! Most certainly, my dear, but. . . ."</p>
<p>"Let me go to bed," I said again, and at the next moment I
stepped into my room.</p>
<p>He did not attempt to follow me. I saw in a mirror in front what
was taking place behind me.</p>
<p>My husband was standing where I had left him with a look first
of amazement and then of rage.</p>
<p>"I can't understand you," he said. "Upon my soul I can't! There
isn't a man in the world who could." After that he strode into his
own bedroom and clashed the door after him.</p>
<p>"Oh, what's the good?" I thought again.</p>
<p>It was impossible to make myself in love with my husband. It was
no use trying.</p>

<p>I must leave it to those who know better than I do the way to
read the deep mysteries of a woman's heart, to explain how it came
to pass that the only result of this incident was to make me sure
that if we remained in London much longer my husband would go back
to the other woman, and to say why (seeing that I did not love him)
I should have become feverishly anxious to remove him from the
range of this temptation.</p>
<p>Yet so it was, for the very next morning, I wrote to my father
saying I had been unwell and begging him to use his influence with
my husband to set out on the Egyptian trip without further
delay.</p>
<p>My father's answer was prompt. What he had read between the
lines of my letter I do not know; what he said was this&mdash;</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Daughter&mdash;Certainly! I am writing to son-in-law telling
him to quit London quick. I guess you've been too long there
already. And while you are away you can draw on me yourself for as
much as you please, for where it is a matter of money you must
never let nobody walk over you.</p>
</div>
<p><span style="margin-left: 21em;">Yours&mdash;&amp;c."</span></p>
<p>The letter to my husband produced an immediate result. Within
twenty-four hours, the telephone was at work with inquiries about
trains and berths on steamers; and within a week we were on our way
to Marseilles to join the ship that was to take us to Port
Said.</p>
<p>Our state-rooms were on the promenade deck of the steamer with a
passage-way between them. This admitted of entirely separate
existences, which was well, for knowing or guessing my share in our
altered arrangements, my husband had become even more morose than
before, and no conversation could be sustained between us.</p>
<p>He spent the greater part of his time in his state-room,
grumbling at the steward, abusing his valet, beating his
bad-tempered terrier and cursing the luck that had brought him on
this senseless voyage.</p>
<p>More than ever now I felt the gulf that divided us. I could not
pass one single hour with him in comfort. My life was becoming as
cold as an empty house, and I was beginning to regret the eagerness
with which I had removed my husband from a scene in which he had at
least lived the life of a rational creature, when an unexpected
event brought me a thrill of passing pleasure.</p>
<p>Our seats in the saloon were at the top of the doctor's table,
and the doctor himself was a young Irishman of three or
four-and-twenty, as bright and breezy as a March morning and as
racy of the soil as new-cut peat.</p>
<p>Hearing that I was from Ellan he started me by asking if by
chance I knew Martin Conrad.</p>
<p>"Martin Conrad?" I repeated, feeling (I hardly knew why) as if a
rosy veil were falling over my face and neck.</p>
<p>"Yes, Mart Conrad, as we call him. The young man who has gone
out as doctor with Lieutenant &mdash;&mdash;'s expedition to the
South Pole?"</p>
<p>A wave of tender feeling from my childhood came surging up to my
throat and I said:</p>
<p>"He was the first of my boy friends&mdash;in fact the only
one."</p>
<p>The young doctor's eyes sparkled and he looked as if he wanted
to throw down his soup-spoon, jump up, and grasp me by both
hands.</p>
<p>"God bless me, is that so?" he said.</p>
<p>It turned out that Martin and he had been friends at Dublin
University. They had worked together, "roomed" together, and taken
their degrees at the same time.</p>
<p>"So you know Mart? Lord alive, the way things come out!"</p>
<p>It was easy to see that Martin was not only his friend but his
hero. He talked of him with a passionate love and admiration with
which men, whatever they feel, rarely speak of each other.</p>
<p>Martin was the salt of the earth. He was the finest fellow and
the staunchest friend and the bravest-hearted chap that walked
under the stars of God.</p>
<p>"The greatest chum I have in the world, too, and by the holy
Immaculate Mother I'm destroyed at being away from him."</p>
<p>It was like music to hear him speak. A flood of joy went
sweeping through me at every word of praise he gave to Martin. And
yet&mdash;I cannot explain why, unless it was the woman in me, the
Irish-woman, or something like it&mdash;but I began to depreciate
Martin, in order to "hoosh" him on, so that he might say more on
the same subject.</p>
<p>"Then he <i>did</i> take his degree," I said. "He was never very
clever at his lessons, I remember, and I heard that he was only
just able to scrape through his examinations."</p>
<p>The young doctor fell to my bait like a darling. With a flaming
face and a nervous rush of racy words which made me think that if I
closed my eyes I should be back on the steps of the church in Rome
talking to Martin himself, he told me I was mistaken if I thought
his friend was a numskull, for he had had "the biggest brain-pan in
College Green," and the way he could learn things when he wanted to
was wonderful.</p>
<p>He might be a bit shaky in his spelling, and perhaps he couldn't
lick the world in Latin, but his heart was always in exploring, and
the way he knew geography, especially the part of it they call the
"Unknown," the Arctic, and the Antarctic, and what Charcot had done
there, and Biscoe and Bellamy and D'Urville and Greely and Nansen
and Shackleton and Peary, was enough to make the provost and
professors look like fools of the earth by the side of him.</p>
<p>"Why, what do you think?" said the doctor. "When he went to
London to apply for his billet, the Lieutenant said to him: 'You
must have been down there before, young man.' 'No such luck,' said
Martin. 'But you know as much about the Antarctic already as the
whole boiling of us put together,' said the Lieutenant. Yes, by St.
Patrick and St. Thomas, he's a geographer any way."</p>
<p>I admitted that much, and to encourage the doctor to go on I
told him where I had seen Martin last, and what he had said of his
expedition.</p>
<p>"In Rome you say?" said the doctor, with a note of jealousy.
"You beat me there then. I saw him off from London, though. A few
of us Dublin boys, being in town at the time, went down to Tilbury
to see him sail, and when they were lifting anchor and the tug was
hitching on, we stood on the pier&mdash;sixteen strong&mdash;and
set up some of our college songs. 'Stop your noising, boys,' said
he, 'the Lieutenant will be hearing you.' But not a bit of it. We
sang away as long as we could see him going out with the tide, and
then we went back in the train, smoking our pipes like so many
Vauxhall chimneys, and narra a word out of the one of us. . . .
Yes, yes, there are some men like that. They come like the stars of
night and go like the light of heaven. Same as there are some women
who walk the world like the sun, and leave the grass growing green
wherever their feet have trod."</p>
<p>It was very ridiculous, I did not then understand why it should
be so, but the tears came gushing into my eyes while the doctor
spoke, and it was as much as I could do to preserve my
composure.</p>
<p>What interpretation my husband put upon my emotion I do not
know, but I saw that his face darkened, and when the doctor turned
to him to ask if he also knew Martin he answered curtly and
brusquely,</p>
<p>"Not I. No loss either, I should say."</p>
<p>"No loss?" said the doctor. "Show me the man under the stars of
God that's fit to hold a candle to Martin Conrad, and by the angel
Gabriel I'll go fifty miles out of my way to put a sight on
him."</p>
<p>More than ever after this talk about Martin Conrad I was feeling
defenceless, and at the mercy of my husband's wishes and whims,
when something happened which seemed to change his character
altogether.</p>
<p>The third day out, on a bright and quiet morning, we called at
Malta, and while my husband went ashore to visit some friends in
the garrison, I sat on deck watching the life of the little port
and looking at the big warships anchored in the bay.</p>
<p>A Maltese woman came on board to sell souvenirs of the island,
and picking out of her tray a tiny twisted thing in coral, I asked
what it was.</p>
<p>"That's a charm, my lady," said the woman.</p>
<p>"A charm for what?"</p>
<p>"To make my lady's husband love her."</p>
<p>I felt my face becoming crimson, but my heart was sore, so in my
simplicity I bought the charm and was smuggling it into my bag when
I became aware that one of my fellow-passengers, a lady, was
looking down at me.</p>
<p>She was a tall, singularly handsome woman, fashionably and
(although on shipboard) almost sumptuously dressed. A look in her
face was haunting me with a memory I could not fix when she stooped
and said:</p>
<p>"Aren't you Mary O'Neill?"</p>
<p>The voice completed the identification, and I knew who it was.
It was Alma Lier.</p>
<p>She was now about seven-and-twenty and in the prime of her young
womanhood. Her beautiful auburn hair lay low over her broad
forehead, almost descending to her long sable-coloured eyebrows.
Her cheeks were very white, (rather beyond the whiteness of nature,
I thought), and her lips were more than commonly red, with the
upper one a little thin and the lower slightly set forward. But her
eyes were still her distinguishing feature, being larger and
blacker than before and having that vivid gaze that looked through
and through you and made you feel that few women and no man in the
world would have the power to resist her.</p>
<p>Her movements were almost noiseless, and as she sank into the
chair by my side there was a certain over-sweetness in the soft
succulent tones of the voice with which she began to tell me what
had happened to her since I had seen her last.</p>
<p>It was a rather painful story. After two or three years in a
girls' college in her own country she had set out with her mother
for a long tour of the European capitals. In Berlin, at what was
falsely called a Charity Ball, she had met a young Russian Count
who was understood to be rich and related to one of the Grand Ducal
families. Against the protests of her father (a shrewd American
banker), she had married the Count, and they had returned to New
York, where her mother had social ambitions.</p>
<p>There they had suffered a serious shock. It turned out that her
husband had deceived them, and that he was really a poor and quite
nameless person, only remotely related to the family he claimed to
belong to.</p>
<p>Nevertheless Alma had "won out" at last. By digging deep into
her father's treasury she got rid of her treacherous husband, and
going "way out west," she had been able, in due time, to divorce
him.</p>
<p>Since then she had resumed her family name, being known as
Madame Lier, and now she was on her way to Egypt to spend the
season at Cairo.</p>
<p>"And you?" she said. "You stayed long at the
convent&mdash;yes?"</p>
<p>I answered that I had, and then in my fluttering voice (for some
of the old spell of her presence had come sweeping back upon me) I
replied one by one to the questions she asked about the Reverend
Mother, the "Reverend Mother Mildred," Sister Angela and Father
Giovanni, not to speak of myself, whom she had always thought of as
"Margaret Mary" because I had looked so innocent and nun-like.</p>
<p>"And now you are married!" she said. "Married so splendidly,
too! We heard all about it. Mother was so interested. What a lucky
girl you are! Everybody says your husband is so handsome and
charming. He is, isn't he?"</p>
<p>I was doing my utmost to put the best face upon my condition
without betraying the facts or simulating sentiments which I could
not feel, when a boat from the shore pulled up at the ship's side,
and my husband stepped on to the deck.</p>
<p>In his usual morose manner he was about to pass without speaking
on his way to his state-room, when his eyes fell on Alma sitting
beside me. Then he stopped and looked at us, and, stepping up, he
said, in a tone I had never heard from him before:</p>
<p>"Mary, my dear, will you not present me to your friend?"</p>
<p>I hesitated, and then with a quivering of the lips I did so. But
something told me as I introduced my husband to Alma, and Alma to
my husband, and they stood looking into each other's eyes and
holding each other's hands (for Alma had risen and I was sitting
between them), that this was the most momentous incident of my life
thus far&mdash;that for good or ill my hour had struck and I could
almost hear the bell.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FORTY_FIFTH_CHAPTER" id=
"FORTY_FIFTH_CHAPTER"></a>FORTY-FIFTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>From that hour forward my husband was a changed man. His manner
to me, so brusque before, became courteous, kind, almost
affectionate. Every morning he would knock at the door of my
state-room to ask if I had slept well, or if the movement of the
steamer had disturbed me.</p>
<p>His manner to Alma was charming. He was up before breakfast
every day, promenading the deck with her in the fresh salt air. I
would slide back my window and hear their laughter as they passed,
above the throb of the engines and the wash of the sea. Sometimes
they would look in upon me and joke, and Alma would say:</p>
<p>"And how's Margaret Mary this morning?"</p>
<p>Our seats in the saloon had been changed. Now we sat with Alma
at the Captain's table, and though I sorely missed the doctor's
racy talk about Martin Conrad I was charmed by Alma's bright wit
and the fund of her personal anecdotes. She seemed to know nearly
everybody. My husband knew everybody also, and their conversation
never flagged.</p>
<p>Something of the wonderful and worshipful feeling I had had for
Alma at the Sacred Heart came back to me, and as for my husband it
seemed to me that I was seeing him for the first time.</p>
<p>He persuaded the Captain to give a dance on our last night at
sea, so the awnings were spread, the electric lights were turned
on, and the deck of the ship became a scene of enchantment.</p>
<p>My husband and Alma led off. He danced beautifully and she was
dressed to perfection. Not being a dancer myself I stood with the
Captain in the darkness outside, looking in on them in the bright
and dazzling circle, while the moon-rays were sweeping the waters
like a silver fan and the little waves were beating the ship's side
with friendly pats.</p>
<p>I was almost happy. In my simplicity I was feeling grateful to
Alma for having wrought this extraordinary change, so that when, on
our arrival at Port Said, my husband said,</p>
<p>"Your friend Madame Lier has made no arrangements for her rooms
at Cairo&mdash;hadn't I better telegraph to our hotel, dear?" I
answered, "Yes," and wondered why he had asked me.</p>
<p>Our hotel was an oriental building, situated on an island at the
further side of the Nile. Formerly the palace of a dead Khedive,
who had built it in honour of the visit of an Empress, it had a
vast reception hall with a great staircase.</p>
<p>There, with separated rooms, as in London, we remained for three
months. I was enthralled. Too young and inexperienced to be
conscious of the darker side of the picture before me, I found
everything beautiful. I was seeing fashionable life for the first
time, and it was entrancing.</p>
<p>Lovely and richly-dressed ladies in silk, velvet, lace, and no
limit of jewellery&mdash;the dark French women, the blonde German
women, the stately English women, and the American women with their
flexuous grace. And then the British soldiers in their various
uniforms, the semi-Turks in their red tarbooshes, and the diplomats
of all nationalities, Italian, Austrian, French, German&mdash;what
a cosmopolitan world it was, what a meeting-place of all
nations!</p>
<p>Every hour had its interest, but I liked best the hour of tea on
the terrace, for that was the glorious hour of woman, when every
condition invested her dress with added beauty and her smile with
greater charm.</p>
<p>Such a blaze of colour in the sunshine! Such a sea of muslin,
flowers, and feathers! Such lovely female figures in diaphanous
clouds of toilettes, delicate as gossamer and varied as the colours
in the rainbow! They were like a living bouquet, as they sat under
the shade of the verandah, with the green lawns and the palm trees
in front, the red-coated orchestra behind, and the noiseless forms
of swarthy Bednouins and Nubians moving to and fro.</p>
<p>Although I had been brought up in such a different world
altogether I could not help being carried away by all this beauty.
My senses burgeoned out and my heart seemed to expand.</p>
<p>As for Alma and my husband, they seemed to belong to the scene
of themselves. She would sit at one of the tea-tables, swishing
away the buzzing flies with a little whip of cord and cowries, and
making comments on the crowd in soft undertones which he alone
seemed to catch. Her vivid and searching eyes, with their constant
suggestion of laughter, seemed to be picking out absurdities on
every side and finding nearly everybody funny.</p>
<p>She found me funny also. My innocence and my convent-bred ideas
were a constant subject of jest with her.</p>
<p>"What does our dear little Margaret Mary think of that?" she
would say with a significant smile, at sights that seemed to me
quite harmless.</p>
<p>After a while I began to have a feeling of indefinable
uneasiness about Alma. She was daily redoubling her cordiality,
always calling me her "dearest sweetest girl," and "the oldest
friend she had in the world." But little by little I became
conscious of a certain commerce between her and my husband in which
I had no part. Sometimes I saw her eyes seeking his, and
occasionally I heard them exchange a few words about me in French,
which (because I did not speak it, being uncertain of my accent)
they thought I did not understand.</p>
<p>Perhaps this helped to sharpen my wits, for I began to see that
I had gone the wrong way to work with my husband. Instead of trying
to make myself fall in love with my husband, I should have tried to
make my husband fall in love with me.</p>
<p>When I asked myself how this was to be done I found one obvious
answer&mdash;I must become the sort of woman my husband admired and
liked; in short I must imitate Alma.</p>
<p>I resolved to do this, and after all that has happened since I
feel a little ashamed to tell of the efforts I made to play a part
for which I was so ill-fitted by nature and education.</p>
<p>Some of them were silly enough perhaps, but some were almost
pathetic, and I am not afraid that any good woman will laugh at the
futile shifts I was put to, in my girlish ignorance, to make my
husband love me.</p>
<p>"I must do it," I thought. "I must, I must!"</p>

<h2><a name="FORTY_SIXTH_CHAPTER" id=
"FORTY_SIXTH_CHAPTER"></a>FORTY-SIXTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Hitherto I had attended to myself, but now I determined to have
a maid. I found one without much difficulty. Her name was Price.
She was a very plain woman of thirty, with piercing black eyes; and
when I engaged her she seemed anxious above all else to make me
understand that she "never saw anything."</p>
<p>I soon discovered that she saw everything, especially the
relations between myself and my husband, and that she put her own
interpretation (not a very flattering one) on our separated
apartments. She also saw the position of Alma, and putting her own
interpretation upon that also, she tortured me with many
pin-pricks.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of my maid I began to haunt the shops of the
dressmakers, the milliners and the jewellers. It did not require
the memory of my father's letter to make me spend his money&mdash;I
spent it like water. Feeling ashamed of my quaker-cut costumes
(Alma had a costume for every day of the week, and wore a large
gold snake on her arm), I bought the most costly toilettes, and
loaded myself with bracelets, rings and necklaces.</p>
<p>I was dressing for my husband, and for him I did many things I
had never dreamt of doing before. For him I filed my nails, put
cream on my skin, perfume on my handkerchief, and even rouge on my
lips. Although I did not allow myself to think of it so, I was
running a race with Alma.</p>
<p>My maid knew that before I did, and the first night she put me
into one of my uncomfortable new gowns she stood off from me and
said:</p>
<p>"His lordship must be a strange gentleman if he can resist you
<i>now</i>."</p>
<p>I felt ashamed, yet pleased too, and went downstairs with a
certain confidence.</p>
<p>The result was disappointing. My husband smiled rather
condescendingly, and though Alma praised me beyond measure I saw
that she was secretly laughing as she said:</p>
<p>"Our Margaret Mary is coming out, isn't she?"</p>
<p>Nevertheless I persevered. Without too much preparation for so
perilous an enterprise, I threw myself into the gaieties of Cairo,
attending polo matches, race-meetings, picnics at the Pyramids,
dances at the different hotels, and on the island of Roda, where
according to tradition, Pharaoh's daughter found Moses in the
bulrushes.</p>
<p>I think I may say that I drew the eyes of other men upon me,
particularly those of the colonel commanding on the Citadel, a fine
type of Scotsman, who paid me the most worshipful attention. But I
thought of nobody but my husband, being determined to make him
forget Alma and fall in love with me.</p>
<p>It was a hopeless task, and I had some heart-breaking hours. One
day, calling at a jeweller's to see a diamond necklace which I
greatly coveted, I was told in confidence that my husband had been
pricing it, but had had to give it up because it was a thousand
francs too dear for him. I was foolish enough to pay the thousand
francs myself, under a pledge of secrecy, and to tell the jeweller
to send the necklace to my husband, feeling sure in my simplicity
that it had been meant for me.</p>
<p>Next night I saw it on Alma's neck, and could have died of
mortification and shame.</p>
<p>I daresay it was all very weak and very childish, but I really
think my last attempt, if rather ridiculous, was also very
pitiful.</p>
<p>Towards the end of our stay the proprietors of the hotel gave a
Cotillon. As this was the event of the season, and nearly every
woman was giving a dinner in honour of it, I resolved that I too
would give one, inviting the gayest of the gay acquaintances I had
made in Cairo.</p>
<p>Feeling that it would be my last battle, and that so much
depended upon it, I dressed myself with feverish care, in a soft
white satin gown, which was cut lower than I had ever worn before,
with slippers to match, a tight band of pearls about my throat and
another about my head.</p>
<p>When Price had finished dressing me she said:</p>
<p>"Well, if his lordship prefers anybody else in the world
to-night I shan't know where he puts his eyes."</p>
<p>The compliment was a crude one, but I had no time to think of
that, for my heart was fluttering with hopes and fears, and I think
any woman would forgive me under the circumstances if I told
myself, as I passed the tall mirrors on the stairs, that I too was
beautiful.</p>
<p>The dining-room was crowded when I entered it with my guests,
and seeing that we were much observed it flashed upon me that my
husband and I had become a subject of gossip. Partly for that
reason I strangled the ugly thing that was writhing in my bosom,
and put Alma (who had flown to me with affectionate rapture) next
to my husband, and the colonel commanding on the Citadel in the
seat beside me.</p>
<p>Throughout the dinner, which was very long, I was very nervous,
and though I did my best to keep up conversation with the colonel,
I knew quite well that I was listening to what was being said at
the other side of my big round table, and as often as any mention
was made of "Margaret Mary" I heard it.</p>
<p>More than once Alma lifted her glass with a gracious nod and
smile, crying, "Mary dearest!" and then in another moment gave my
husband one of her knowing glances which seemed to me to say, "Look
at that foolish little wife of yours!"</p>
<p>By the time we returned to the hall for coffee we were rather a
noisy party, and even the eyes of the ladies betrayed the fact that
they had dined. The talk, which had grown louder, was also a little
more free, and God forgive me, I joined in it, being feverishly
anxious to outdo Alma, and be looked upon as a woman of the
world.</p>
<p>Towards eleven o'clock, the red-coated orchestra began to play a
waltz, and then the whole variegated company of ladies, soldiers,
and diplomats stood up to dance, and the colonel asked me to join
him.</p>
<p>I was ashamed to tell him that I had never danced except with a
schoolgirl, so I took his hand and started. But hardly had we
begun, when I made mistakes, which I thought everybody saw (I am
sure Alma saw them), and before we had taken many turns my partner
had to stop, whereupon I retired to my seat with a forced laugh and
a sense of confusion.</p>
<p>It was nearly twelve when they began the Cotillon, which Alma
and my husband led with supreme self-possession. As one of the
hostesses I sat in the front row of the square, and when I was
taken out I made further mistakes, which also Alma saw and
communicated by smiles to my husband.</p>
<p>Before the Cotillon came to an end the night was far spent and
then the company, which had become very boisterous, began to look
for some new excitement, no matter how foolish. One or other
started "turkey trot" and "grizzly bear" and finally Alma, with
memories of the winter sports at St. Moritz, proposed that they
should toboggan down the great staircase.</p>
<p>The suggestion was welcomed with a shout, and a broad board was
immediately laid on the first long flight of stairs for people to
slide on.</p>
<p>Soldiers went first, and then there were calls for the ladies,
when Alma took her turn, tucking her dress under her at the top and
alighting safely on her feet at the bottom. Other ladies followed
her example, with similar good fortune, and then Alma, who had been
saying "Such fun! Such lots of fun!" set up a cry of "Margaret
Mary."</p>
<p>I refused at first, feeling ashamed of even looking at such
unwomanly folly, but something Alma said to my husband and
something that was conveyed by my husband's glance at me set my
heart afire and, poor feverish and entangled fool that I was, I
determined to defy them.</p>
<p>So running up to the top and seating myself on the toboggan I
set it in motion. But hardly had I done so when it swayed, reeled,
twisted and threw me off, with the result that I rolled downstairs
to the bottom.</p>
<p>Of course there were shrieks of laughter, and if I had been in
the spirit of the time and place I suppose I should have laughed
too, and there would have been an end of the matter. But I had been
playing a part, a tragic part, and feeling that I had failed and
covered myself with ridicule, I was overwhelmed with confusion.</p>
<p>I thought my husband would be angry with me, and feel
compromised by my foolishness, but he was not; he was amused, and
when at last I saw his face it was running in rivulets from the
laughter he could not restrain.</p>
<p>That was the end of all things, and when Alma came up to me,
saying everything that was affectionate and insincere, about her
"poor dear unfortunate Margaret Mary" (only women know how to wound
each other so), I brushed her aside, went off to my bedroom, and
lay face down on the sofa, feeling that I was utterly beaten and
could fight no more.</p>
<p>Half an hour afterwards my husband came in, and though I did not
look up I heard him say, in a tone of indulgent sympathy that cut
me to the quick:</p>
<p>"You've been playing the wrong part, my child. A Madonna, yes,
but a Venus, no! It's not your <i>m&eacute;tier</i>."</p>
<p>"What's the good? What's the good? What's the good?" I asked
myself.</p>
<p>I thought my heart was broken.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FORTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"FORTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER"></a>FORTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>With inexpressible relief I heard the following day that we were
to leave for Rome immediately.</p>
<p>Alma was to go with us, but that did not matter to me in the
least. Outside the atmosphere of this place, so artificial, so
unrelated to nature, her power over my husband would be gone. Once
in the Holy City everything would be different. Alma would be
different, I should be different, above all my husband would be
different. I should take him to the churches and basilicas; I
should show him the shrines and papal processions, and he would see
me in my true "part" at last!</p>
<p>But what a deep disappointment awaited me!</p>
<p>On reaching Rome we put up at a fashionable hotel in the new
quarter of the Ludovisi, and although that was only a few hundred
yards from the spot on which I had spent nine happy years it seemed
to belong to another world altogether. Instead of the church domes
and the monastery bells, there were the harsh clang of electric
trams, the thrum and throb of automobiles, the rattle of cars and
the tramp of soldiers.</p>
<p>Then I realised that there were two Romes&mdash;an old Rome and
a new one, and that the Rome we had come to hardly differed from
the Cairo we had left behind.</p>
<p>There was the same varied company of people of all nations,
English, Americans, French, German; the same nomad tribes of the
rich and dissolute, pitching their tents season by season in the
sunny resorts of Europe; the same aimless society, the same debauch
of fashion, the same callous and wicked luxury, the same thirst for
selfish pleasures, the same busy idleness, the same corruption of
character and sex.</p>
<p>This made me very unhappy, but from first to last Alma was in
the highest spirits. Everybody seemed to be in Rome that spring,
and everybody seemed to be known either to her or to my husband.
For Alma's sake we were invited everywhere, and thus we saw not
only the life of the foreign people of the hotels but that of a
part (not the better part) of the Roman aristocracy.</p>
<p>Alma was a great success. She had the homage of all the men, and
being understood to be rich, and having the gift of making every
man believe he was her special favourite, she was rarely without a
group of Italian noblemen about her chair.</p>
<p>With sharper eyes the Italian women saw that her real reckoning
lay with my husband, but they seemed to think no worse of her for
that. They seemed to think no worse of him either. It was nothing
against him that, having married me (as everybody appeared to know)
for the settlement of his financial difficulties, he had
transferred his attentions, even on his honeymoon, to this
brilliant and alluring creature.</p>
<p>As for me, I was made to realise that I was a person of a
different class altogether. When people wished to be kind they
called me <i>spirituelle</i>, and when they were tempted to be the
reverse they voted me insipid.</p>
<p>As a result I became very miserable in this company, and I can
well believe that I may have seemed awkward and shy and stupid when
I was in some of their grey old palaces full of tapestry and
bronze, for I sometimes found the talk there so free (especially
among the women) that the poisoned jokes went quivering through
me.</p>
<p>Things I had been taught to think sacred were so often derided
that I had to ask myself if it could be Rome, my holy and beloved
Rome&mdash;this city of license and unbelief.</p>
<p>But Alma was entirely happy, especially when the talk turned on
conjugal fidelity, and the faithful husband was held up to
ridicule. This happened very often in one house we used to go
to&mdash;that of a Countess of ancient family who was said to have
her husband and her lover at either side of her when she sat down
to dinner.</p>
<p>She was a large and handsome person of middle age, with a great
mass of fair hair, and she gave me the feeling that in her case the
body of a woman was inhabited by the soul of a man.</p>
<p>She christened me her little Irish <i>bambino</i>, meaning her
child; and one night in her drawing-room, after dinner, before the
men had joined us, she called me to her side on the couch, lit a
cigarette, crossed her legs, and gave us with startling candour her
views of the marriage bond.</p>
<p>"What can you expect, you women?" she said. "You run after the
men for their titles&mdash;they've very little else, except debts,
poor things&mdash;and what is the result? The first result is that
though you have bought them you belong to them. Yes, your husband
owns his beautiful woman, just as he owns his beautiful horse or
his beautiful dog."</p>
<p>This was so pointed that I felt my face growing crimson, but
Alma and the other women only laughed, so the Countess went on:</p>
<p>"What then? Once in a blue moon each goes his and her own way
without sin. You agree to a sort of partnership for mutual
advantage in which you live together in chastity under the same
roof. What a life! What an ice-house!"</p>
<p>Again the other women laughed, but I felt myself blushing
deeply.</p>
<p>"But in the majority of cases it is quite otherwise. The
business purpose served, each is open to other emotions. The man
becomes unfaithful, and the woman, if she has any spirit, pays him
out tit for tat&mdash;and why shouldn't she?"</p>
<p>After that I could bear no more, and before I knew what I was
saying I blurted out:</p>
<p>"But I find that wrong and wicked. Infidelity on the part of the
man does not justify infidelity in the woman. The prayer-book says
so."</p>
<p>Alma burst out laughing, and the Countess smiled and
continued:</p>
<p>"Once in a hundred years there comes a great passion&mdash;Dante
and Beatrice, Petrarch and Laura. The woman meets the right man too
late. What a tragedy! What a daily and hourly crucifixion! Unless,"
said the Countess with emphasis, "she is prepared to renounce the
law and reject society and live a life of complete emancipation.
But in a Catholic country, where there is no divorce, what woman
can afford to do that? Nobody in the higher classes
can&mdash;especially if she has to sacrifice her title. So the wise
woman avoids scandal, keeps her little affair with her lover to
herself, and . . . and that's marriage, my dears."</p>
<p>A twitter of approval, led by Alma, came from the other women,
but I was quivering with anger and I said:</p>
<p>"Then marriage is an hypocrisy and an imposture. If I found I
loved somebody better than my husband, I should go to him in spite
of the law, and society, and title and . . . and everything."</p>
<p>"Of course you would, my dear," said the Countess, smiling at me
as at a child, "but that's because you are such a sweet, simple,
innocent little Irish <i>bambino</i>."</p>
<p>It must have been a day or two after this that we were invited
to the Roman Hunt. I had no wish to go, but Alma who had begun to
use me in order to "save her face" in relation to my husband,
induced me to drive them out in a motor-car to the place on the
Campagna where they were to mount their horses.</p>
<p>"Dear sweet girl!" said Alma. "How could we possibly go without
you?"</p>
<p>It was Sunday, and I sat between Alma in her riding habit and my
husband in his riding breeches, while we ran through the Porta San
Giovanni, and past the <i>osterie</i> where the pleasure-loving
Italian people were playing under the pergolas with their children,
until we came to the meeting-ground of the Hunt, by the Trappist
monastery of Tre Fontane.</p>
<p>A large company of the Roman aristocracy were gathered there
with their horses and hounds, and they received Alma and my husband
with great cordiality. What they thought of me I do not know,
except that I was a childish and complacent wife; and when at the
sound of the horn the hunt began, and my husband and Alma went
prancing off with the rest, without once looking back, I asked
myself in my shame and distress if I could bear my humiliation much
longer.</p>
<p>But then came a moment of unexpected pleasure. A cheerful voice
on the other side of the car said:</p>
<p>"Good morning, Lady Raa."</p>
<p>It was the young Irish doctor from the steamer. His ship had put
into Naples for two days, and, like Martin Conrad before my
marriage, he had run up to look at Rome.</p>
<p>"But have you heard the news?" he cried.</p>
<p>"What news?"</p>
<p>"About the South Pole Expedition&mdash;they're on their way
home."</p>
<p>"So soon?"</p>
<p>"Yes, they reached New Zealand on Saturday was a week."</p>
<p>"And . . . and . . . and Martin Conrad?"</p>
<p>"He's well, and what's better, he has distinguished
himself."</p>
<p>"I . . . I . . . I knew he would."</p>
<p>"So did I! The way I was never fearing that if they gave Mart
half a chance he would come out top! Do or die&mdash;that was his
watch-word."</p>
<p>"I know! I know!"</p>
<p>His eyes were sparkling and so I suppose were mine, while with a
joyous rush of racy words, (punctuated by me with "Yes," "Yes,"
"Yes") he told of a long despatch from the Lieutenant published by
one of the London papers, in which Martin had been specially
mentioned&mdash;how he had been put in command of some difficult
and perilous expedition, and had worked wonders.</p>
<p>"How splendid! How glorious! How perfectly magnificent!" I
said.</p>
<p>"Isn't it?" said the doctor, and for a few moments more we
bandied quick questions and replies like children playing at
battledore and shuttlecock. Then he said:</p>
<p>"But I'm after thinking it's mortal strange I never heard him
mention you. There was only one chum at home he used to talk about
and that was a man&mdash;a boy, I mean. Mally he was calling
him&mdash;that's short for Maloney, I suppose."</p>
<p>"For Mary," I said.</p>
<p>"Mary, is it? Why, by the saints, so it is! Where in the name of
St. Patrick has been the Irish head at me that I never thought of
that before? And you were . . . Yes? Well, by the powers, ye've a
right to be proud of him, for he was thinking pearls and diamonds
of you. I was mortal jealous of Mally, I remember. 'Mally's a
stunner,' he used to say. 'Follow you anywhere, if you wanted it,
in spite of the devil and hell.'"</p>
<p>The sparkling eyes were growing misty by this time but the woman
in me made me say&mdash;I couldn't help it&mdash;</p>
<p>"I dare say he's had many girl friends since my time,
though?"</p>
<p>"Narra a one. The girls used to be putting a glime on him in
Dublin&mdash;they're the queens of the world too, those Dublin
girls&mdash;but never a skute of the eye was he giving to the one
of them. I used to think it was work, but maybe it wasn't . . .
maybe it was. . . ."</p>
<p>I dare not let him finish what I saw he was going to say&mdash;I
didn't know what would happen to me if he did&mdash;so I jumped in
by telling him that, if he would step into the car, I would drive
him back to Rome.</p>
<p>He did so, and all the way he talked of Martin, his courage and
resource and the hardships he had gone through, until (with
backward thoughts of Alma and my husband riding away over the
Campagna) my heart, which had been leaping like a lamb, began to
ache and ache.</p>
<p>We returned by the Old Appian Way, where the birds were building
their nests among the crumbling tombs, through the Porta San Paolo,
and past the grave of the "young English poet" of whom I have
always thought it was not so sad that he died of consumption as in
the bitterness of a broken heart.</p>
<p>All this time I was so much at home with the young Irish doctor,
who was Martin's friend, that it was not until I was putting him
down at his hotel that I remembered I did not even know his
name.</p>
<p>It was O'Sullivan.</p>

<h2><a name="FORTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER" id=
"FORTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER"></a>FORTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Every day during our visit to Rome I had reminded myself of the
Reverend Mother's invitation to call on her, and a sense of moral
taint had prevented me, but now I determined to see her at least by
going to Benediction at her Convent church the very next day.</p>
<p>It happened, however, that this was the time when the Artists'
Club of Rome were giving a Veglione (a kind of fancy-dress ball),
and as Alma and my husband desired to go to it, and were still in
the way of using me to keep themselves in countenance, I consented
to accompany them on condition that I did not dress or dance, and
that they would go with me to Benediction the following day.</p>
<p>"Dear sweet girl!" said Alma. "We'll do whatever you like. Of
course we will."</p>
<p>I wore my soft satin without any ornaments, and my husband
merely put scarlet facings on the lapels of his evening coat, but
Alma was clad in a gorgeous dress of old gold, with Oriental skirts
which showed her limbs in front but had a long train behind, and
made her look like a great vampire bat.</p>
<p>It was eleven o'clock before we reached the theatre, but already
the auditorium was full, and so well had the artists done their
work of decoration, making the air alive with floating specks of
many-coloured lights, like the fire-flies at Nemi, that the scene
was one of enchantment.</p>
<p>It was difficult to believe that on the other side of the walls
was the street, with the clanging electric bells and people
hurrying by with their collars up, for the night was cold, and it
had begun to rain as we came in, and one poor woman, with a child
under her shawl, was standing by the entrance trying to sell
evening papers.</p>
<p>I sat alone in a box on the ground tier while Alma and my
husband and their friends were below on the level of the
<i>poltroni</i> (the stalls) that had been arranged for the
dancing, which began immediately after we arrived and went on
without a break until long after midnight.</p>
<p>Then there was supper on the stage, and those who did not eat
drank a good deal until nearly everybody seemed to be under the
influence of alcohol. As a consequence many of the people,
especially some of the women (not good women I fear), seemed to
lose all control of themselves, singing snatches of noisy songs,
sipping out of the men's glasses, taking the smoke of cigarettes
out of the men's mouths, sitting on the men's knees, and even
riding astride on the men's arms and shoulders.</p>
<p>I bore these sights as long as I could, making many fruitless
appeals to my husband to take me home; and I was just about to
leave of myself, being sick of the degradation of my sex, when a
kind of rostrum, with an empty chair on top of it, was carried in
on the shoulders of a number of men.</p>
<p>This was for the enthronement of the Queen of Beauty, and as it
passed round the arena, with the mock judges in paper coronets,
walking ahead to make their choice, some of the women, lost to all
sense of modesty, were shouting "Take <i>me</i>! Take
<i>me</i>!"</p>
<p>I felt sure they would take Alma, so I reached forward to get a
better view of her, where she stood below my box; but as they
approached her, with the chair still empty, I saw her make a
movement in my direction and say something to the judges about "the
little nun," which made my husband nod his head and then laugh
uproariously.</p>
<p>At the next moment, before I knew what they were doing, six or
seven men jumped into my box, lifted me on to the rostrum and
placed me in the chair, whereupon the whole noisy company in the
theatre broke into wild shouts of salutation and pelted me with
flowers and confetti.</p>
<p>If there was any pride there was more mortification in the
position to which Alma and my husband had exposed me, for as I was
being carried round the arena, with the sea of foaming faces below
me, all screaming out of their hot and open mouths, I heard the men
cry:</p>
<p>"Smile, Signorina!"</p>
<p>"Not so serious, Mademoiselle!"</p>
<p>It would do no good to say what memories of other scenes flashed
back on my mind as I was being borne along in the mad procession. I
felt as if it would last for ever. But it came to an end at length,
and as soon as I was released, I begged my husband again to take me
home, and when he said, "Not yet; we'll all be going by-and-by," I
stole away by myself, found a cab, and drove back to the hotel.</p>
<p>The day was dawning as I passed through the stony streets, and
when I reached my room, and pulled down my dark green blinds, the
bell of the Capuchin monastery in the Via Veneto was ringing and
the monks were saying the first of their offices.</p>
<p>I must have been some time in bed, hiding my hot face in the
bed-clothes, when Price, my maid, came in to apologise for not
having seen me come back alone. The pain of the woman's scrutiny
was more than I could bear at that moment, so I tried to dismiss
her, but I could not get her to go, and at last she said:</p>
<p>"If you please, my lady, I want to say something."</p>
<p>I gave her no encouragement, yet she continued.</p>
<p>"I daresay it's as much as my place is worth, but I'm bound to
say it."</p>
<p>Still I said nothing, yet she went on:</p>
<p>"His Lordship and Madame have also arrived. . . . They came back
half an hour ago. And just now . . . I saw his lordship . . .
coming out of Madame's room."</p>
<p>"Go away, woman, go away," I cried in the fierce agony of my
shame, and she went out at last, closing the door noisily behind
her.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>We did not go next day to Benediction at the Reverend Mother's
church. But late the same night, when it was quite dark, I crept
out of my room into the noisy streets, hardly knowing where my
footsteps were leading me, until I found myself in the piazza of
the Convent of the Sacred Heart.</p>
<p>It was quiet enough there. Only the Carabinieri were walking on
the paved way with measured steps, and the bell of the Dominican
monastery was slowly ringing under the silent stars. I could see
the light on the Pope's loggia at the Vatican and hear the clock of
St. Peter's striking nine.</p>
<p>There were lights in the windows of some of the dormitories
also, and by that I knew that the younger children, the children of
the Infant Jesus, were going to bed. There was a light too, in the
large window of the church, and that told me that the bigger girls
were saying their night prayers.</p>
<p>Creeping close to the convent wall I heard the girls' voices
rising and falling, and then through the closed door of the church
came the muffled sound of their evening hymn&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Ave maris stella<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Dei Mater
Alma&mdash;"</span><br /></i></p>
<p>I did not know why I was putting myself wilfully to this bitter
pain&mdash;the pain of remembering the happy years in which I
myself was a girl singing so, and then telling myself that other
girls were there now who knew nothing of me.</p>
<p>I thought of the Reverend Mother, and then of my own mother, my
saint, my angel, who had told me to think of her when I sang that
hymn; and then I remembered where I was and what had happened to
me.</p>
<p>"<i>Virgin of all virgins,<br />
To thy shelter take me</i>."</p>
<p>I felt like an outcast. A stifling sensation came into my throat
and I dropped to my knees in the darkness. I thought I was
broken-hearted.</p>

"FORTY_NINTH_CHAPTER"></a>FORTY-NINTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Not long after that we left Italy on our return to England. We
were to reach home by easy stages so as to see some of the great
capitals of Europe, but I had no interest in the journey.</p>
<p>Our first stay was at Monte Carlo, that sweet garden of the
Mediterranean which God seems to smile upon and man to curse.</p>
<p>If I had been allowed to contemplate the beautiful spectacle of
nature I think I could have been content, but Alma, with her
honeyed and insincere words, took me to the Casino on the usual
plea of keeping her in countenance.</p>
<p>I hated the place from the first, with its stale air, its chink
of louis d'or, its cry of the croupiers, its strained faces about
the tables, and its general atmosphere of wasted hopes and fears
and needless misery and despair.</p>
<p>As often as I could I crept out to look at the flower
f&ecirc;tes in the streets, or to climb the hill of La Turbie and
think I was on my native rocks with Martin Conrad, or even to sit
in my room and watch the poor wounded pigeons from the pigeon-traps
as they tumbled and ducked into the sea after the shots fired, by
cruel and unsportsmanlike sportsmen, from the rifle-range
below.</p>
<p>In Monte Carlo my husband's vices seemed to me to grow rank and
fast. The gambling fever took complete possession of him. At first
he won and then he drank heavily, but afterwards he lost and then
his nature became still more ugly and repulsive.</p>
<p>One evening towards eight o'clock, I was in my room, trying to
comfort a broken-winged pigeon which had come floundering through
the open window, when my husband entered with wild eyes.</p>
<p>"The red's coming up at all the tables," he cried breathlessly.
"Give me some money, quick!"</p>
<p>I told him I had no money except the few gold pieces in my
purse.</p>
<p>"You've a cheque book&mdash;give me a cheque, then."</p>
<p>I told him that even if I gave him a cheque he could not cash it
that night, the banks being closed.</p>
<p>"The jewellers are open though, and you have jewels, haven't
you? Stop fooling with that creature, and let me have some of them
to pawn."</p>
<p>The situation was too abject for discussion, so I pointed to the
drawer in which my jewels were kept, and he tore it open, took what
he wanted and went out hurriedly without more words.</p>
<p>After that I saw no more of him for two days, when with black
rings about his eyes he came in to say he must leave "this accursed
place" immediately or we should all be ruined.</p>
<p>Our last stopping-place was Paris, and in my ignorance of the
great French capital which has done so much for the world, I
thought it must be the sink of every kind of corruption.</p>
<p>We put up at a well-known hotel in the Champs Elys&eacute;es,
and there (as well as in the caf&eacute;s in the Bois and at the
races at Longchamps on Sundays) we met the same people again, most
of them English and Americans on their way home after the winter.
It seemed to me strange that there should be so many men and women
in the world with nothing to do, merely loafing round it like
tramps&mdash;the richest being the idlest, and the idlest the most
immoral.</p>
<p>My husband knew many Frenchmen of the upper classes, and I think
he spent several hours every day at their clubs, but (perhaps at
Alma's instigation) he made us wallow through the filth of Paris by
night.</p>
<p>"It will be lots of fun," said Alma. "And then who is to know us
in places like those?"</p>
<p>I tolerated this for a little while, and then refused to be
dragged around any longer as a cloak for Alma's pleasures. Telling
myself that if I continued to share my husband's habits of life,
for any reason or under any pretext, I should become like him, and
my soul would rot inch by inch, I resolved to be clean in my own
eyes and to resist the contaminations of his company.</p>
<p>As a consequence, he became more and more reckless, and Alma
made no efforts to restrain him, so that it came to pass at last
that they went together to a scandalous entertainment which was for
a while the talk of the society papers throughout Europe.</p>
<p>I know no more of this entertainment than I afterwards learned
from those sources&mdash;that it was given by a notorious woman,
who was not shut out of society because she was "the good friend"
of a King; that she did the honours with clever imitative elegance;
that her salon that night was crowded with such male guests as one
might see at the court of a queen&mdash;princes, dukes, marquises,
counts, English noblemen and members of parliament, as well as some
reputable women of my own and other countries; that the tables were
laid for supper at four o'clock with every delicacy of the season
and wines of the rarest vintage; that after supper dancing was
resumed with increased animation; and that the dazzling and
improper spectacle terminated with a <i>Cha&icirc;ne diabolique</i>
at seven in the morning, when the sun was streaming through the
windows and the bells of the surrounding churches were ringing for
early mass.</p>
<p>I had myself risen early that morning to go to communion at the
Madeleine, and never shall I forget the effect of cleansing
produced upon me by the sacred sacrament. From the moment
when&mdash;the priest standing at the foot of the altar&mdash;the
choir sang the <i>Kyrie eleison</i>, down to the solemn silence of
the elevation, I had a sense of being washed from all the taint of
the contaminating days since my marriage.</p>
<p>The music was Perosi's, I remember, and the voices in the
<i>Gloria in excelsis</i>, which I used to sing myself, seemed to
carry up the cry of my sorrowful heart to the very feet of the
Virgin whose gracious figure hung above me.</p>
<p>"Cleanse me and intercede for me, O Mother of my God."</p>
<p>It was as though our Blessed Lady did so, for as I walked out of
the church and down the broad steps in front of it, I had a feeling
of purity and lightness that I had never known since my time at the
Sacred Heart.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful day, with all the freshness and fragrance of
early morning in summer, when the white stone houses of Paris seem
to blush in the sunrise; and as I walked up the Champs
Elys&eacute;es on my way back to the hotel, I met under the
chestnut trees, which were then in bloom, a little company of young
girls returning to school after their first communion.</p>
<p>How sweet they looked! In their white muslin frocks, white shoes
and stockings and gloves, white veils and coronets of white
flowers, they were twittering away as merrily as the little birds
that were singing unseen in the leaves above them.</p>
<p>It made me feel like a child myself to look at their sweet
faces; but turning into the hotel I felt like a woman too, for I
thought the great and holy mystery, the sacrament of union and
love, had given me such strength that I could meet any further
wrong I might have to endure in my walk through the world with
charity and forgiveness.</p>
<p>But how little a woman knows of her heart until it is tried in
the fires of passion!</p>
<p>As I entered the salon which (as usual) divided my husband's
bedroom from mine, I came upon my maid, Price, listening intently
at my husband's closed door. This seemed to me so improper that I
was beginning to reprove her, when she put her finger to her lip
and coming over to me with her black eyes ablaze she said:</p>
<p>"I know you will pack me off for what I'm going to say, yet I
can't help that. You've stood too much already, my lady, but if you
are a woman and have any pride in yourself as a wife, go and listen
at that door and see if you can stand any more."</p>
<p>With that she went out of the salon, and I tried to go to my own
room, but I could not stir. Something held me to the spot on which
I stood, and I found myself listening to the voices which I could
distinctly hear in my husband's bedroom.</p>
<p>There were two voices, one a man's, loud and reckless, the other
a woman's soft and cautious.</p>
<p>There was no need to tell myself whose voices they were, and
neither did I ask myself any questions. I did not put to my mind
the pros and cons of the case for myself or the case for my
husband. I only thought and felt and behaved as any other wife
would think and feel and behave at such a moment. An ugly and
depraved thing, which my pride or my self-respect had never
hitherto permitted me to believe in, suddenly leapt into life.</p>
<p>I was outraged. I was a victim of the treachery, the duplicity,
the disloyalty, and the smothered secrecy of husband and
friend.</p>
<p>My heart and soul were aflame with a sense of wrong. All the
sweetening and softening and purifying effects of the sacrament
were gone in an instant, and, moving stealthily across the carpet
towards my husband's door, I swiftly turned the handle.</p>
<p>The door was locked.</p>
<p>I heard a movement inside the room and in a moment I hurried
from the salon into the corridor, intending to enter by another
door. As I was about to do so I heard the lock turned back by a
cautious hand within. Then I swung the door open and boldly entered
the room.</p>
<p>Nobody was there except my husband.</p>
<p>But I was just in time to catch the sound of rustling skirts in
the adjoining apartment and to see a door closed gently behind
them.</p>
<p>I looked around. Although the sun was shining, the blinds were
down and the air was full of a rank odour of stale tobacco such as
might have been brought back in people's clothes from that
shameless woman's salon.</p>
<p>My husband, who had clearly been drinking, was looking at me
with a half-senseless grin. His thin hair was a little disordered.
His prominent front teeth showed hideously. I saw that he was
trying to carry things off with an air.</p>
<p>"This <i>is</i> an unexpected pleasure. I think it must be the
first time . . . the very first time that. . . ."</p>
<p>I felt deadly cold; I almost swooned; I could scarcely breathe,
but I said:</p>
<p>"Is that all you've got to say to me?"</p>
<p>"All? What else, my dear? I don't understand. . . ."</p>
<p>"You understand quite well," I answered, and then looking
towards the door of the adjoining apartment, I said, "both of you
understand."</p>
<p>My husband began to laugh&mdash;a drunken, idiotic laugh.</p>
<p>"Oh, you mean that . . . perhaps you imagine that. . . ."</p>
<p>"Listen," I said. "This is the end of everything between you and
me."</p>
<p>"The end? Why, I thought that was long ago. In fact I thought
everything ended before it began."</p>
<p>"I mean. . . ." I knew I was faltering . . . "I mean that I can
no longer keep up the farce of being your wife."</p>
<p>"Farce!" Again he laughed. "I congratulate you, my dear. Farce
is exactly the word for it. Our relations have been a farce ever
since the day we were married, and if anything has gone wrong you
have only yourself to blame for it. What's a man to do whose wife
is no company for anybody but the saints and angels?"</p>
<p>His coarse ridicule cut me to the quick. I was humiliated by the
thought that after all in his own gross way my husband had
something to say for himself.</p>
<p>Knowing I was no match for him I wanted to crawl away without
another word. But my silence or the helpless expression of my face
must have been more powerful than my speech, for after a few
seconds in which he went on saying in his drawling way that I had
been no wife to him, and if anything had happened I had brought it
on myself, he stopped, and neither of us spoke for a moment.</p>
<p>Then feeling that if I stayed any longer in that room I should
faint, I turned to go, and he opened the door for me and bowed low,
perhaps in mockery, as I passed out.</p>
<p>When I reached my own bedroom I was so weak that I almost
dropped, and so cold that my maid had to give me brandy and put hot
bottles to my feet.</p>
<p>And then the tears came and I cried like a child.</p>

<h2><a name="FIFTIETH_CHAPTER" id="FIFTIETH_CHAPTER"></a>FIFTIETH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I was far from well next morning and Price wished to keep me in
bed, but I got up immediately when I heard that my husband was
talking of returning to London.</p>
<p>Our journey was quite uneventful. We three sat together in the
railway carriage and in the private cabin on the steamer, with no
other company than Bimbo, my husband's terrier, and Prue, Alma's
Pekinese spaniel.</p>
<p>Although he made no apology for his conduct of the day before my
husband was quiet and conciliatory, and being sober he looked
almost afraid, as if telling himself that he might have to meet my
father soon&mdash;the one man in the world of whom he seemed to
stand in fear.</p>
<p>Alma looked equally frightened, but she carried off her
nervousness with a great show of affection, saying she was sorry I
was feeling "badly," that France and the South did not agree with
me, and that I should be ever so much better when I was "way up
north."</p>
<p>We put up at a well-known hotel near Trafalgar Square, the same
that in our girlhood had been the subject of Alma's dreams of
future bliss, and I could not help observing that while my husband
was selecting our rooms she made a rather ostentatious point of
asking for an apartment on another floor.</p>
<p>It was late when we arrived, so I went to bed immediately, being
also anxious to be alone that I might think out my course of
action.</p>
<p>I was then firmly resolved that one way or other my life with my
husband should come to an end; that I would no longer be befouled
by the mire he had been dragging me through; that I should live a
clean life and drink a pure draught, and oh, how my very soul
seemed to thirst for it!</p>
<p>This was the mood in which I went to sleep, but when I awoke in
the morning, almost before the dawn, the strength of my resolution
ebbed away. I listened to the rumble of the rubber-bound wheels of
the carriages and motor-cars that passed under my window and,
remembering that I had not a friend in London, I felt small and
helpless. What could I do alone? Where could I turn for
assistance?</p>
<p>Instinctively I knew it would be of no use to appeal to my
father, for though it was possible that he might knock my husband
down, it was not conceivable that he would encourage me to separate
from him.</p>
<p>In my loneliness and helplessness I felt like a shipwrecked
sailor, who, having broken away from the foundering vessel that
would have sucked him under, is yet tossing on a raft with the
threatening ocean on every side, and looking vainly for a sail.</p>
<p>At last I thought of Mr. Curphy, my father's advocate, and
decided to send a telegram to him asking for the name of some
solicitor in London to whom I could apply for advice.</p>
<p>To carry out this intention I went down to the hall about nine
o'clock, when people were passing into the breakfast-room, and
visitors were calling at the bureau, and livened page-boys were
shouting names in the corridors.</p>
<p>There was a little writing-room at one side of the hall and I
sat there to write my telegram. It ran&mdash;</p>
<p>"Please send name and address reliable solicitor London whom I
can consult on important business."</p>
<p>I was holding the telegraph-form in my hand and reading my
message again and again to make sure that it would lead to no
mischief, when I began to think of Martin Conrad.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that some one had mentioned his name, but I told
myself that must have been a mistake,&mdash;that, being so helpless
and so much in need of a friend at that moment, my heart and not my
ears had heard it.</p>
<p>Nevertheless as I sat holding my telegraph-form I became
conscious of somebody who was moving about me. It was a man, for I
could smell the sweet peaty odour of his Harris tweeds.</p>
<p>At length with that thrill which only the human voice can bring
to us when it is the voice of one from whom we have been long
parted, I heard somebody say, from the other side of the desk:</p>
<p>"Mary, is it you?"</p>
<p>I looked up, the blood rushed to my face and a dazzling mist
floated before my eyes, so that for a moment I could hardly see who
was there. But I <i>knew</i> who it was&mdash;it was Martin
himself.</p>
<p>He came down on me like a breeze from the mountain, took me by
both hands, telegram and all, and said:</p>
<p>"My goodness, this is stunning!"</p>
<p>I answered, as well as I could for the confusion that
overwhelmed me.</p>
<p>"I'm so glad, so glad!"</p>
<p>"How well you are looking! A little thin, perhaps, but such a
colour!"</p>
<p>"I'm so glad, so glad!" I repeated, though I knew I was only
blushing.</p>
<p>"When did you arrive?"</p>
<p>I told him, and he said:</p>
<p>"<i>We</i> came into port only yesterday. And to think that you
and I should come to the same hotel and meet on the very first
morning! It's like a fate, as our people in the island say. But
it's stunning, perfectly stunning!"</p>
<p>A warm tide of joy was coursing through me and taking away my
breath, but I managed to say:</p>
<p>"I've heard about your expedition. You had great hardships."</p>
<p>"That was nothing! Just a little pleasure-trip down to the
eighty-sixth latitude."</p>
<p>"And great successes?"</p>
<p>"That was nothing either. The chief was jolly good, and the boys
were bricks."</p>
<p>"I'm so glad, so glad!" I said again, for a kind of dumb joy had
taken possession of me, and I went on saying the same thing over
and over again, as people do when they are very happy.</p>
<p>For two full minutes I felt happier than I had ever been in my
life before; and then an icy chill came over me, for I remembered
that I had been married since I saw Martin Conrad last and I did
not know how I was to break the news to him.</p>
<p>Just then my husband and Alma came down the lift, and seeing me
with a stranger, as they crossed the hall to go into the
breakfast-room, they came up and spoke.</p>
<p>I had to introduce them and it was hard to do, for it was
necessary to reveal everything in a word. I looked at Martin Conrad
when I presented him to my husband and he did not move a muscle.
Then I looked at my husband and under a very small bow his face
grew dark.</p>
<p>I could not help seeing the difference between the two men as
they stood together&mdash;Martin with his sea-blue eyes and his
look of splendid health, and my husband with his sallow cheeks and
his appearance of wasted strength&mdash;and somehow from some
unsearchable depths of my soul the contrast humbled me.</p>
<p>When I introduced Alma she took Martin's hand and held it while
she gazed searchingly into his eyes from under her eyebrows, as she
always did when she was being presented to a man; but I saw that in
this instance her glance fell with no more effect on its object
than a lighted vesta on a running stream.</p>
<p>After the usual banal phrases my husband inquired if Martin was
staying in the house, and then asked if he would dine with us some
day.</p>
<p>"Certainly! Delighted! With all the pleasure in the world," said
Martin.</p>
<p>"Then," said my husband with rather frigid politeness, "you will
see more of your friend Mary."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Alma, in a way that meant much, "you will see more
of your friend Mary."</p>
<p>"Don't you worry about that, ma'am. You <i>bet</i> I will," said
Martin, looking straight into Alma's eyes; and though she laughed
as she passed into the breakfast-room with my husband, I could see
that for the first time in her life a man's face had frightened
her.</p>
<p>"Then you knew?" I said, when they were gone.</p>
<p>"Yes; a friend of mine who met you abroad came down to see us
into port and he . . ."</p>
<p>"Dr. O'Sullivan?"</p>
<p>"That's the man! Isn't he a boy? And, my gracious, the way he
speaks of you! But now . . . now you must go to breakfast yourself,
and I must be off about my business."</p>
<p>"Don't go yet," I said.</p>
<p>"I'll stay all day if you want me to; but I promised to meet the
Lieutenant on the ship in half an hour, and . . ."</p>
<p>"Then you must go."</p>
<p>"Not yet. Sit down again. Five minutes will do no harm. And by
the way, now that I look at you again, I'm not so sure that you . .
. Italy, Egypt, there's enough sun down there, but you're pale . .
. a little pale, aren't you?"</p>
<p>I tried to make light of my pallor but Martin looked uneasy, and
after a moment he asked:</p>
<p>"How long are you staying in London?"</p>
<p>I told him I did not know, whereupon he said:</p>
<p>"Well, I'm to be here a month, making charts and tables and
reports for the Royal Geographical Society, but if you want me for
anything . . . do you want me now?"</p>
<p>"No-o, no, not now," I answered.</p>
<p>"Well, if you <i>do</i> want me for anything&mdash;anything at
all, mind, just pass the word and the charts and the tables and the
reports and the Royal Geographical Society may go to the . . .
Well, somewhere."</p>
<p>I laughed and rose and told him he ought to go, though at the
bottom of my heart I was wishing him to stay, and thinking how
little and lonely I was, while here was a big brave man who could
protect me from every danger.</p>
<p>We walked together to the door, and there I took his hand and
held it, feeling, like a child, that if I let him go he might be
lost in the human ocean outside and I should see no more of
him.</p>
<p>At last, struggling hard with a lump that was gathering in my
throat, I said:</p>
<p>"Martin, I have been so happy to see you. I've never been so
happy to see anybody in my life. You'll let me see you again, won't
you?"</p>
<p>"Won't I? Bet your life I will," he said, and then, as if seeing
that my lip was trembling and my eyes were beginning to fill, he
broke into a cheerful little burst of our native tongue, so as to
give me a "heise" as we say in Ellan and to make me laugh at the
last moment.</p>
<p>"Look here&mdash;keep to-morrow for me, will ye? If them ones"
(my husband and Alma) "is afther axing ye to do anything else just
tell them there's an ould shipmate ashore, and he's wanting ye to
go 'asploring.' See? So-long!"</p>
<p>It had been like a dream, a beautiful dream, and as soon as I
came to myself in the hall, with the visitors calling at the bureau
and the page-boys shouting in the corridors, I found that my
telegraph-form, crumpled and crushed, was still in the palm of my
left hand.</p>
<p>I tore it up and went in to breakfast.</p>

<p>During our first day in London my husband had many visitors,
including Mr. Eastcliff and Mr. Vivian, who had much to tell and
arrange about.</p>
<p>I dare say a great many events had happened during our six
months' absence from England; but the only thing I heard of was
that Mr. Eastcliff had married his dancing-girl, that she had
retired from the stage, and that her public appearances were now
confined to the box-seat of a four-in-hand coach, which he drove
from London to Brighton.</p>
<p>This expensive toy he proposed to bring round to the hotel the
following day, which chanced to be Derby Day, when a party was to
be made up for the races.</p>
<p>In the preparations for the party, Alma, who, as usual,
attracted universal admiration, was of course included, but I did
not observe that any provision was made for me, though that
circumstance did not distress me in the least, because I was
waiting for Martin's message.</p>
<p>It came early next morning in the person of Martin himself, who,
running into our sitting-room like a breath of wind from the sea,
said his fellow officers were separating that day, each going to
his own home, and their commander had invited me to lunch with them
on their ship, which was lying off Tilbury.</p>
<p>It did not escape me that my husband looked relieved at this
news, and that Alma's face brightened as she said in her most
succulent tones:</p>
<p>"I should go if I were you, Mary. The breeze on the river will
do you a world of good, dear."</p>
<p>I was nothing loath to take them at their word, so I let them go
off in their four-in-hand coach, a big and bustling party, while
with a fast-beating heart I made ready to spend the day with
Martin, having, as I thought, so much and such serious things to
say to him.</p>
<p>A steam launch from the ship was waiting for us at the
Westminster Pier, and from the moment I stepped into it I felt like
another woman. It was a radiant day in May, when the climate of our
much-maligned London is the brightest and best, and the biggest
city in the world is also the most beautiful.</p>
<p>How I loved it that day! The sunlight, the moving river, the
soft air of early summer, the passing panorama of buildings, old
and new&mdash;what a joy it was to me I sat on a side seat, dipping
my hand over the gunwale into the cool water, while Martin, with a
rush of racy words, was pointing out and naming everything.</p>
<p>St. Paul's was soon past, with the sun glistening off the golden
cross on its dome; then London Bridge; then the Tower, with its
Traitors' Gate; then the new Thames Bridge; and then we were in the
region of the barges and wharfs and warehouses, with their colliers
and coasting traders, and with the scum of coal and refuse floating
on the surface of the stream.</p>
<p>After that came uglier things still, which we did not mind, and
then the great docks with the hammering of rivets and the cranking
noise of the lightermen's donkey engines, loading and unloading the
big steamers and sailing ships; and then the broad reaches of the
river where the great liners, looking so high as we steamed under
them, lay at anchor to their rusty cable-chains, with their
port-holes gleaming in the sun like rows of eyes, as Martin said,
in the bodies of gigantic fish.</p>
<p>At last we came out in a fresh breadth of water, with marshes on
either side and a far view of the sea, and there, heaving a little
to the flowing tide, and with a sea-gull floating over her mizzen
mast, lay Martin's ship.</p>
<p>She was a wooden schooner, once a Dundee whaler called the
<i>Mary</i> but now re-christened the <i>Scotia</i>, and it would
be silly to say how my eyes filled at sight of her, just because
she had taken Martin down into the deep Antarctic and brought him
safely back again.</p>
<p>"She's a beauty, isn't she?" said Martin.</p>
<p>"Isn't she?" I answered, and in spite of all my troubles I felt
entirely happy.</p>
<p>We had steamed down against a strong tide, so we were half an
hour late for luncheon, and the officers had gone down to the
saloon, but it was worth being a little after time to see the way
they all leapt up and received me like a queen&mdash;making me
feel, as I never felt before, the difference between the politeness
of the fashionable idlers and the manners of the men who do
things.</p>
<p>"Holloa!" they cried.</p>
<p>"Excuse us, won't you? We thought something had happened and
perhaps you were not coming," said the commander, and then he put
me to sit between himself and Martin.</p>
<p>The strange thing was that I was at home in that company in a
moment, and if anybody imagines that I must have been embarrassed
because I was the only member of my sex among so many men he does
not know the heart of a woman.</p>
<p>They were such big, bronzed manly fellows with the note of
health and the sense of space about them&mdash;large space&mdash;as
if they had come out of the heroic youth of the world, that they
set my blood a-tingling to look at them.</p>
<p>They were very nice to me too, though I knew that I only stood
for the womankind that each had got at home and was soon to go back
to, but none the less it was delightful to feel as if I were taking
the first fruits of their love for them.</p>
<p>So it came to pass that within a few minutes I, who had been
called insipid and was supposed to have no conversation, was
chattering away softly and happily, making remarks about the things
around me and asking all sorts of questions.</p>
<p>Of course I asked many foolish ones, which made the men laugh
very much; but their laughter did not hurt me the least bit in the
world, because everybody laughed on that ship, even the sailors who
served the dishes, and especially one grizzly old salt, a cockney
from Wapping, who for some unexplained reason was called
Treacle.</p>
<p>It made me happy to see how they all deferred to Martin, saying:
"Isn't that so, Doctor?" or "Don't you agree, Doctor?" and though
it was strange and new to hear Martin (my "Mart of Spitzbergen")
called "Doctor," it was also very charming.</p>
<p>After luncheon was over, and while coffee was being served, the
commander sent Treacle to his cabin for a photograph of all hands
which had been taken when they were at the foot of Mount Erebus;
and when it came I was called upon to identify one by one, the
shaggy, tousled, unkempt, bearded, middle-aged men in the picture
with the smart, clean-shaven young officers who sat round me at the
table.</p>
<p>Naturally I made shockingly bad shots, and the worst of them was
when I associated Treacle with the commander, which made the latter
rock in his seat and the former shake and shout so much that he
spilled the coffee.</p>
<p>"But what about the fourth man in the front row from the left?"
asked the commander.</p>
<p>"Oh, I should recognise him if I were blindfolded," I
answered.</p>
<p>"By what?"</p>
<p>"By his eyes," I said, and after this truly Irish and feminine
answer the men shrieked with laughter.</p>
<p>"She's got you there, doc," cried somebody.</p>
<p>"She has sure," said Martin, who had said very little down to
that moment, but was looking supremely happy.</p>
<p>At length the time came for the men to go, and I went up on deck
to see them off by the launch, and then nobody was left on the ship
except Martin and myself, with the cook, the cabin-boy and a few of
the crew, including Treacle.</p>
<p>I knew that that was the right time to speak, but I was too
greedy of every moment of happiness to break in on it with the
story of my troubles, so when Martin proposed to show me over the
ship, away I went with him to look at the theodolites and
chronometers and sextants, and sledges and skis, and the aeronautic
outfit and the captive balloon, and the double-barrelled guns, and
the place where they kept the petroleum and the gun cotton for
blasting the ice, and the hold forward for the men's provisions in
hermetically-sealed tins, and the hold aft for the dried fish and
biscuit that were the food for the Siberian dogs, and the empty
cage for the dogs themselves, which had just been sent up to the
Zoo to be taken care of.</p>
<p>Last of all he showed me his own cabin, which interested me more
than anything else, being such a snug little place (though I
thought I should like to tidy it up a bit), with his medical
outfit, his books, his bed like a shelf, and one pretty photograph
of his mother's cottage with the roses growing over it, that I
almost felt as if I would not mind going to the Antarctic myself if
I could live in such comfortable quarters.</p>
<p>Two hours passed in this way, though they had flown like five
minutes, when the cabin-boy came to say that tea was served in the
saloon, and then I skipped down to it as if the ship belonged to
me. And no sooner had I screwed myself into the commander's chair,
which was fixed to the floor at the head of the narrow table, and
found the tea-tray almost on my lap, than a wave of memory from our
childhood came sweeping back on me, and I could not help giving way
to the coquetry which lies hidden in every girl's heart so as to
find out how much Martin had been thinking of me.</p>
<p>"I'll bet you anything," I said, (I had caught Martin's style)
"you can't remember where you and I first saw each other."</p>
<p>He could&mdash;it was in the little dimity-white room in his
mother's house with its sweet-smelling "scraas" under the sloping
thatch.</p>
<p>"Well, you don't remember what you were doing when we held our
first conversation?"</p>
<p>He did&mdash;he was standing on his hands with his feet against
the wall and his inverted head close to the carpet.</p>
<p>"But you've forgotten what happened next?"</p>
<p>He hadn't&mdash;I had invited William Rufus and himself into
bed, and they had sat up on either side of me.</p>
<p>Poor William Rufus! I heard at last what had become of him. He
had died of distemper soon after I was sent to school. His master
had buried him in the back-garden, and, thinking I should be as
sorry as he was for the loss of our comrade, he had set up a stone
with an inscription in our joint names&mdash;all of his own
inditing. It ran&mdash;he spelled it out to me&mdash;</p>
<p>"HERE LICE WILYAM ROOFUS WRECKTED<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">BY IZ OLE FRENS MARTIN
CONRAD</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">AND MARY O'NEILL."</span></p>
<p>Two big blinding beads came into my eyes at that story, but they
were soon dashed away by Martin who saw them coming and broke into
the vernacular. I broke into it, too, (hardly knowing that the well
of my native speech was still there until I began to tap it), and
we talked of Tommy the Mate and his "starboard eye," called each
other "bogh mulish," said things were "middling," spoke of the
"threes" (trees) and the "tunder" (thunder), and remembered that
"our Big Woman was a wicked devil and we wouldn't trust but she'd
burn in hell."</p>
<p>How we laughed! We laughed at everything; we laughed at nothing;
we laughed until we cried; but I have often thought since that this
was partly because we knew in our secret hearts that we were always
hovering on the edge of tragic things.</p>
<p>Martin never once mentioned my husband or my marriage, or his
letters to my father, the Bishop and Father Dan, which had turned
out so terribly true; but we had our serious moments for all that,
and one of them was when we were bending over a large chart which
he had spread out on the table to show me the course of the ship
through the Great Unknown, leaning shoulder to shoulder, so close
that our heads almost touched, and I could see myself in his eyes
as he turned to speak to me.</p>
<p>"You were a little under the weather yesterday,
shipmate&mdash;what was the cause of it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, we . . . we can talk of that another time, can't we?" I
answered, and then we both laughed again, goodness knows why,
unless it was because we felt we were on the verge of unlocking the
doors of each other's souls.</p>
<p>Oh that joyful, wonderful, heart-swelling day! But no day ever
passed so quickly. At half-past six Martin said we must be going
back, or I should be late for dinner, and a few minutes afterwards
we were in the launch, which had returned to fetch us.</p>
<p>I had had such a happy time on the ship that as we were steaming
off I kissed my hand to her, whereupon Treacle, who was standing at
the top of the companion, taking the compliment to himself,
returned the salute with affectionate interest, which sent Martin
and me into our last wild shriek of laughter.</p>
<p>The return trip was just as delightful as the coming out had
been, everything looking different the other way round, for the
sunset was like a great celestial fire which had been lighted in
the western sky, and the big darkening city seemed to have turned
its face to it.</p>
<p>Martin talked all the way back about a scheme he had afoot for
going down to the region of the Pole again in order to set up some
machinery that was to save life and otherwise serve humanity, and
while I sat close up to him, looking into his flashing
eyes&mdash;they were still as blue as the bluest sea&mdash;I said,
again and again: "How splendid! How glorious! What a great, great
thing it will be for the world."</p>
<p>"Won't it?" he said, and his eyes sparkled like a boy's.</p>
<p>Thus the time passed without our being aware how it was going,
and we were back at Westminster Pier before I bethought me that of
the sad and serious subject I had intended to speak about I had
said nothing at all.</p>
<p>But all London seemed to have been taking holiday that day, for
as we drove in a taxi up Parliament Street streams of vehicles full
of happy people were returning from the Derby, including costers'
donkey carts in which the girls were carrying huge boughs of May
blossom, and the boys were wearing the girls' feathery hats, and at
the top of their lusty lungs they were waking the echoes of the
stately avenue with the "Honeysuckle and the Bee."</p>
<p>"<i>Yew aw the enny, Oi em ther bee,<br />
Oi'd like ter sip ther enny from those red lips, yew see</i>."</p>
<p>As we came near our hotel we saw a rather showy four-in-hand
coach, called the "Phoebus," drawing up at the covered way in front
of it, and a lady on top, in a motor veil, waving her hand to
us.</p>
<p>It was Alma, with my husband's and Mr. Eastcliff's party back
from the races, and as soon as we met on the pavement she began to
pay me high compliments on my improved appearance.</p>
<p>"Didn't I say the river air would do you good, dearest?" she
said, and then she added something else, which would have been very
sweet if it had been meant sweetly, about there being no surer way
to make a girl beautiful than to make her happy.</p>
<p>There was some talk of our dining together that night, but I
excused myself, and taking leave of Martin, who gave my hand a
gentle pressure, I ran upstairs without waiting for the lift, being
anxious to get to my own room that I might be alone and go over
everything in my mind.</p>
<p>I did so, ever so many times, recalling all that had been said
and done by the commander and his comrades, and even by Treacle,
but above all by Martin, and laughing softly to myself as I lived
my day over again in a world of dream.</p>
<p>My maid came in once or twice, with accounts of the gorgeous
Derby dinner that was going on downstairs, but that did not matter
to me in the least, and as soon as I had swallowed a little food I
went to bed early&mdash;partly in order to get rid of Price that I
might go over everything again and yet again.</p>
<p>I must have done so far into the night, and even when the wings
of my memory were weary of their fluttering and I was dropping off
at last, I thought I heard Martin calling "shipmate," and I said
"Yes," quite loud, as if he had been with me still in that vague
and beautiful shadow-land which lies on the frontier of sleep.</p>
<p>How mysterious, how magical, how wonderful!</p>
<p>Looking back I cannot but think it strange that even down to
that moment I did not really know what was happening to me, being
only conscious of a great flood of joy. I cannot but think it
strange that, though Nature had been whispering to me for months, I
did not know what it had been saying. I cannot but think it strange
that, though I had been looking for love so long without finding
it, I did not recognise it immediately when it had come to me of
itself.</p>
<p>But when I awoke early in the morning, very early, while the
sunrise was filling my bedroom with a rosy flush, and the thought
of Martin was the first that was springing from the mists of sleep
to my conscious mind, and I was asking myself how it happened that
I was feeling so glad, while I had so many causes for grief, then
suddenly&mdash;suddenly as the sun streams through the cloud-scud
over the sea&mdash;I knew that what had long been predestined had
happened, that the wondrous new birth, the great revelation, the
joyous mystery which comes to every happy woman in the world had
come at last to me.</p>
<p>I was in love.</p>
<p>I was in love with Martin Conrad.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FIFTY_SECOND_CHAPTER" id=
"FIFTY_SECOND_CHAPTER"></a>FIFTY-SECOND CHAPTER</h2>
<p>My joy was short-lived. No sooner had I become aware that I
loved Martin Conrad, than my conscience told me I had no right to
do so. I was married, and to love another than my husband was
sin.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to say with what terror this thought
possessed me. It took all the sunlight out of my sky, which a
moment before had seemed so bright. It came on me like a storm of
thunder and lightning, sweeping my happiness into the abyss.</p>
<p>All my religion, everything I had been taught about the sanctity
of the sacrament of marriage seemed to rise up and accuse me. It
was not that I was conscious of any sin against my husband. I was
thinking only of my sin against God.</p>
<p>The first effect was to make me realise that it was no longer
possible for me to speak to Martin about my husband and Alma. To do
this now that I knew I loved him would be deceitful, mean, almost
treacherous.</p>
<p>The next effect was to make me see that all thought of a
separation must now be given up. How could I accuse my husband when
I was myself in the same position? If he loved another woman, I
loved another man.</p>
<p>In my distress and fright I saw only one means of escape either
from the filthy burden to which I was bound or the consciousness of
a sinful heart, and that was to cure myself of my passion. I
determined to do so. I determined to fight against my love for
Martin Conrad, to conquer it and to crush it.</p>
<p>My first attempt to do this was feeble enough. It was an effort
to keep myself out of the reach of temptation by refusing to see
Martin alone.</p>
<p>For three or four days I did my best to carry out this purpose,
making one poor excuse after another, when (as happened several
times a day) he came down to see me&mdash;that I was just going out
or had just come in, or was tired or unwell.</p>
<p>It was tearing my heart out to deny myself so, but I think I
could have borne the pain if I had not realised that I was causing
pain to him also.</p>
<p>My maid, whose head was always running on Martin, would come
hack to my room, after delivering one of my lying excuses, and
say:</p>
<p>"You should have seen his face, when I told him you were ill. It
was just as if I'd driven a knife into him."</p>
<p>Everybody seemed to be in a conspiracy to push me into Martin's
arms&mdash;Alma above all others. Being a woman she read my secret,
and I could see from the first that she wished to justify her own
conduct in relation to my husband by putting me into the same
position with Martin.</p>
<p>"Seen Mr. Conrad to-day?" she would ask.</p>
<p>"Not to-day," I would answer.</p>
<p>"Really? And you such old friends! And staying in the same
hotel, too!"</p>
<p>When she saw that I was struggling hard she reminded my husband
of his intention of asking Martin to dinner, and thereupon a night
was fixed and a party invited.</p>
<p>Martin came, and I was only too happy to meet him in company,
though the pain and humiliation of the contrast between him and my
husband and his friends, and the difference of the atmosphere in
which he lived from that to which I thought I was doomed for ever,
was almost more than I could bear.</p>
<p>I think they must have felt it themselves, for though their
usual conversation was of horses and dogs and race-meetings, I
noticed they were silent while Martin in his rugged, racy poetic
way (for all explorers are poets) talked of the beauty of the great
Polar night, the cloudless Polar day, the midnight calm and the
moonlight on the glaciers, which was the loveliest, weirdest, most
desolate, yet most entrancing light the world could show.</p>
<p>"I wonder you don't think of going back to the Antarctic, if
it's so fascinating," said Alma.</p>
<p>"I do. Bet your life I do," said Martin, and then he told them
what he had told me on the launch, but more fully and even more
rapturously&mdash;the story of his great scheme for saving life and
otherwise benefiting humanity.</p>
<p>For hundreds of years man, prompted merely by the love of
adventure, the praise of achievement, and the desire to know the
globe he lived on, had been shouldering his way to the hitherto
inviolable regions of the Poles; but now the time had come to turn
his knowledge to account.</p>
<p>"How?" said my husband.</p>
<p>"By putting himself into such a position," said Martin, "that he
will be able to predict, six, eight, ten days ahead, the weather of
a vast part of the navigable and habitable world&mdash;by
establishing installations of wireless telegraphy as near as
possible to the long ice-barrier about the Pole from which
ice-floes and icebergs and blizzards come, so that we can say in
ten minutes from the side of Mount Erebus to half the southern
hemisphere, 'Look out. It's coming down,' and thus save millions of
lives from shipwreck, and hundreds of millions of money."</p>
<p>"Splendid, by Jove!" said Mr. Eastcliff.</p>
<p>"Yes, ripping, by jingo!" said Mr. Vivian.</p>
<p>"A ridiculous dream!" muttered my husband, but not until Martin
had gone, and then Alma, seeing that I was all aglow, said:</p>
<p>"What a lovely man! I wonder you don't see more of him, Mary, my
love. He'll be going to the ends of the earth soon, and then you'll
be sorry you missed the chance."</p>
<p>Her words hurt me like the sting of a wasp, but I could not
resist them, and when some days later Martin called to take me to
the Geographical Society, where his commander, Lieutenant
&mdash;&mdash; was to give an account of their expedition, I could
not find it in my heart to refuse to go.</p>
<p>Oh, the difference of this world from that in which I had been
living for the past six months! All that was best in England seemed
to be there, the men who were doing the work of the world, and the
women who were their wives and partners.</p>
<p>The theatre was like the inside of a dish, and I sat by Martin's
side on the bottom row of seats, just in front of the platform and
face to face with the commander.</p>
<p>His lecture, which was illustrated by many photographic lantern
slides of the exploring party, (including the one that had been
shown to me on the ship) was very interesting, but terribly
pathetic; and when he described the hardships they had gone through
in a prolonged blizzard on a high plateau, with food and fuel
running low, and no certainty that they would ever see home again,
I found myself feeling for Martin's hand to make sure that he was
there.</p>
<p>Towards the end the commander spoke very modestly of himself,
saying he could never have reached the 87th parallel if he had not
had a crew of the finest comrades that ever sailed on a ship.</p>
<p>"And though they're all splendid fellows," he said, "there's one
I can specially mention without doing any wrong to the rest, and
that's the young doctor of our expedition&mdash;Martin Conrad.
Martin has a scheme of his own for going down to the Antarctic
again to make a great experiment in the interests of humanity, and
if and when he goes I say, 'Good luck to him and God bless
him!'"</p>
<p>At these generous words there was much applause, during which
Martin sat blushing like a big boy when he is introduced to the
girl friends of his sister.</p>
<p>As for me I did not think any speech could have been so
beautiful, and I felt as if I could have cried for joy.</p>
<p>When I got back to the hotel I <i>did</i> cry, but it was for
another reason. I was thinking of my father and wondering why he
did not wait.</p>
<p>"Why, why, why?" I asked myself.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FIFTY_THIRD_CHAPTER" id=
"FIFTY_THIRD_CHAPTER"></a>FIFTY-THIRD CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Next day, Martin came rushing down to my sitting-room with a
sheaf of letters in his hand, saying:</p>
<p>"That was jolly good of the boss, but look what he has let me in
for?"</p>
<p>They were requests from various newspapers for portraits and
interviews, and particularly from one great London journal for a
special article to contain an account of the nature and object of
the proposed experiment.</p>
<p>"What am I to do?" he said. "I'm all right for stringing gabble,
but I couldn't <i>write</i> anything to save my soul. Now, you
could. I'm sure you could. You could write like Robinson Crusoe.
Why shouldn't you write the article and I'll tell you what to put
into it?"</p>
<p>There was no resisting that. And down at the bottom of my secret
heart I was glad of the excuse to my conscience that I could not
any longer run away from Martin because I was necessary to help
him.</p>
<p>So we sat together all day long, and though it was like shooting
the rapids to follow Martin's impetuous and imaginative speech, I
did my best to translate his disconnected outbursts into more
connected words, and when the article was written and read aloud to
him he was delighted.</p>
<p>"Stunning! Didn't I say you could write like Robinson
Crusoe?"</p>
<p>In due course it was published and made a deep impression, for
wherever I went people were talking of it, and though some said
"Fudge!" and others, like my husband, said "Dreams!" the practical
result was that the great newspaper started a public subscription
with the object of providing funds for the realisation of Martin's
scheme.</p>
<p>This brought him an immense correspondence, so that every
morning he came down with an armful of letters and piteous appeals
to me to help him to reply to them.</p>
<p>I knew it would be dangerous to put myself in the way of so much
temptation, but the end of it was that day after day we sat
together in my sitting-room, answering the inquiries of the
sceptical, the congratulations of the convinced, and the offers of
assistance that came from people who wished to join in the
expedition.</p>
<p>What a joy it was! It was like the dawn of a new life to me. But
the highest happiness of all was to protect Martin against himself,
to save him from his over-generous impulses&mdash;in a word, to
mother him.</p>
<p>Many of the letters he received were mere mendicancy. He was not
rich, yet he could not resist a pitiful appeal, especially if it
came from a woman, and it was as much as I could do to restrain him
from ruining himself.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would see him smuggle a letter into his side pocket,
with&mdash;</p>
<p>"H'm! That will do later."</p>
<p>"What is it?" I would ask.</p>
<p>"Oh, nothing, nothing!" he would answer.</p>
<p>"Hand it out, sir," I would say, and then I would find a fierce
delight in sending six freezing words of refusal to some impudent
woman who was trying to play upon the tender side of my big-hearted
boy.</p>
<p>Oh, it was delightful! My whole being seemed to be renewed. If
only the dear sweet hours could go on and on for ever!</p>
<p>Sometimes my husband and Alma would look in upon us at our work,
and then, while the colour mounted to my eyes, Martin would
say:</p>
<p>"I'm fishing with another man's floats, you see."</p>
<p>"I see," my husband would reply, fixing his monocle and showing
his front teeth in a painful grin.</p>
<p>"Just what dear Mary loves, though," Alma would say. "I do
believe she would rather he sitting in this sunless room, writing
letters for Mr. Conrad, than wearing her coronet at a King's
coronation."</p>
<p>"Just so, ma'am; there <i>are</i> women like that," Martin would
answer, looking hard at her; and when she had gone, (laughing
lightly but with the frightened look I had seen before) he would
say, as if speaking to himself:</p>
<p>"I hate that woman. She's like a snake. I feel as if I want to
put my foot on it."</p>
<p>At length the climax came. One day Martin rushed downstairs
almost beside himself in his boyish joy, to say that all the money
he needed had been subscribed, and that in honour of the maturing
of the scheme the proprietor of the newspaper was to give a public
luncheon at one of the hotels, and though no women were to be
present at the "feed" a few ladies were to occupy seats in a
gallery, and I was to be one of them.</p>
<p>I had played with my temptation too long by this time to shrink
from the dangerous exaltation which I knew the occasion would
cause, so when the day came I went to the hotel in a fever of
pleasure and pride.</p>
<p>The luncheon was nearly over, the speeches were about to begin,
and the ladies' gallery was buzzing like a hive of bees, when I
took my seat in it. Two bright young American women sitting next to
me were almost as excited as myself, and looking down at the men
through a pair of opera-glasses they were asking each other which
was Martin, whereupon my vanity, not to speak of my sense of
possession, was so lifted up that I pointed him out to them, and
then borrowed their glasses to look at the chairman.</p>
<p>He seemed to me to have that light of imagination in his eyes
which was always blazing in Martin's, and when he began to speak I
thought I caught the note of the same wild passion.</p>
<p>He said they were that day opening a new chapter in the
wonderful book of man's story, and though the dangers of the great
deep might never be entirely overcome, and the wind would continue
to blow as it listed, yet the perils of the one and the movements
of the other were going to be known to, and therefore checked by,
the human family.</p>
<p>After that, and a beautiful tribute to Martin as a man, (that
everybody who had met him had come to love him, and that there must
be something in the great solitudes of the silent white world to
make men simple and strong and great, as the sea made them staunch
and true) he drank to the success of the expedition, and called on
Martin to respond to the toast.</p>
<p>There was a great deal of cheering when Martin rose, but I was
so nervous that I hardly heard it. He was nervous too, as I could
plainly see, for after a few words of thanks, he began to fumble
the sheets of a speech which he and I had prepared together, trying
to read it, but losing his place and even dropping his papers.</p>
<p>Beads of perspiration were starting from my forehead and I knew
I was making noises in my throat, when all at once Martin threw his
papers on the table and said, in quite another voice:</p>
<p>"Ship-mates, I mean gentlemen, I never could write a speech in
my life, and you see I can't read one, but I know what I want to
say and if you'll take it as it comes here goes."</p>
<p>Then in the simple style of a sailor, not always even
grammatical yet splendidly clear and bold and natural, blundering
along as he used to do when he was a boy at school and could not
learn his lessons, but with his blue eyes ablaze, he told of his
aims and his expectations.</p>
<p>And when he came to the end he said:</p>
<p>"His lordship, the chairman, has said something about the good
effects of the solitudes of Nature on a man's character. I can
testify to that. And I tell you this&mdash;whatever you are when
you're up here and have everything you want, it's wonderful strange
the way you're asking the Lord to stretch out His hand and help you
when you're down there, all alone and with an empty hungry
stomach.</p>
<p>"I don't know where you were last Christmas Day, shipmates . . .
I mean gentlemen, but I know where I was. I was in the 85th
latitude, longitude 163, four miles south and thirty west of Mount
Darwin. It was my own bit of an expedition that my commander has
made too much of, and I believe in my heart my mates had had enough
of it. When we got out of our sleeping bags that morning there was
nothing in sight but miles and miles of rolling waves of snow,
seven thousand feet up on a windy plateau, with glaciers full of
crevasses shutting us off from the sea, and not a living thing in
sight as far as the eye could reach.</p>
<p>"We were six in company and none of us were too good for
Paradise, and one&mdash;he was an old Wapping sailor, we called him
Treacle&mdash;had the name of being a shocking old rip ashore. But
we remembered what day it was, and we wanted to feel that we
weren't cut off entirely from the world of Christian men&mdash;our
brothers and sisters who would be going to church at home. So I dug
out my little prayer-book that my mother put in my kit going away,
and we all stood round bare-headed in the snow&mdash;a shaggy old
lot I can tell you, with chins that hadn't seen a razor for a
month&mdash;and I read the prayers for the day, the first and
second Vespers, and Laudate Dominum and then the De Profundis.</p>
<p>"I think we felt better doing that, but they say the comical and
the tragical are always chasing each other, which can get in first,
and it was so with us, for just as I had got to an end with the
solemn words, 'Out of the depths we cry unto thee, O Lord, Lord
hear our cry,' in jumps old Treacle in his thickest cockney, 'And
Gawd bless our pore ole wives and sweethearts fur a-wye.'"</p>
<p>If Martin said any more nobody heard it. The men below were
blowing their noses, and the women in the gallery were crying
openly.</p>
<p>"Well, the man who can talk like that may open all my letters
and telegrams," said one of the young American women, who was
wiping her eyes without shame.</p>
<p>What I was doing, and what I was looking like, I did not know
until the lady, who had lent me the opera-glasses leaned over to me
and said:</p>
<p>"Excuse me, but are you his wife, may I ask?"</p>
<p>"Oh no, no," I said nervously and eagerly, but only God knows
how the word went through and through me.</p>
<p>I had taken the wrong course, and I knew it. My pride, my joy,
my happiness were all accusing me, and when I went to bed that
night I felt as if I had been a guilty woman.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FIFTY_FOURTH_CHAPTER" id=
"FIFTY_FOURTH_CHAPTER"></a>FIFTY-FOURTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I tried to take refuge in religion. Every day and all day I
humbly besought the pardon of heaven for the sin of loving Martin
Conrad.</p>
<p>The little religious duties which I had neglected since my
marriage (such as crossing myself at rising from the table) I began
to observe afresh, and being reminded by Martin's story that I had
promised my mother to say a De Profundis for her occasionally I now
said one every day. I thought these exercises would bring me a
certain relief, but they did not.</p>
<p>I searched my Missal for words that applied to my sinful state,
and every night on going to bed I prayed to God to take from me all
unholy thoughts, all earthly affections. But what was the use of my
prayers when in the first dream of the first sleep I was rushing
into Martin's arms?</p>
<p>It was true that my love for Martin was what the world would
call a pure love; it had no alloy of any kind; but all the same I
thought I was living in a condition of adultery&mdash;adultery of
the heart.</p>
<p>Early every morning I went to mass, but the sense I used to have
of returning from the divine sacrifice to the ordinary occupations
of life with a new spirit and a clean heart I could feel no
longer.</p>
<p>I went oftener to confession than I had done before&mdash;twice
a week to begin with, then every other day, then every day. But the
old joy, the sense of purity and cleansing, did not come. I thought
at first the fault might be with my Confessor, for though I knew I
was in the presence of God, the whispering voice behind the
grating, which used to thrill me with a feeling of the
supernatural, was that of a young man, and I asked myself what a
young priest could know by experience of the deep temptations of
human love.</p>
<p>This was at the new Cathedral at Westminster, so I changed to a
little Catholic church in a kind of mews in Mayfair, and there my
Confessor was an older man whose quivering voice seemed to search
the very depths of my being. He was deeply alarmed at my condition
and counselled me to pray to God night and day to strengthen me
against temptation.</p>
<p>"The Evil One is besieging your soul, my child," he said. "Fight
with him, my daughter."</p>
<p>I tried to follow my ghostly father's direction, but how hard it
was to do so! Martin had only to take my hand and look into my eyes
and all my good resolutions were gone in a moment.</p>
<p>As a result of the fierce struggle between my heart and my soul
my health began to fail me. From necessity now, and not from
design, I had to keep my room, but even there my love for Martin
was always hanging like a threatening sword over my head.</p>
<p>My maid Price was for ever singing his praises. He was so
bright, so cheerful, so strong, so manly; in fact, he was perfect,
and any woman in the world might be forgiven if she fell in love
with him.</p>
<p>Her words were like music in my ears, and sometimes I felt as if
I wanted to throw my arms about her neck and kiss her. But at other
moments I reproved her, telling her it was very wicked of her to
think so much of the creature instead of fixing her mind on the
Creator&mdash;a piece of counsel which made Price, who was all
woman, open her sparkling black eyes in bewilderment.</p>
<p>Nearly every morning she brought me a bunch of flowers, which
Martin had bought at Covent Garden, all glittering from the
sunshine and damp with the dew. I loved to have them near me, but,
finding they tempted me to think more tenderly of him who sent
them, I always contrived by one excuse or another to send them into
the sitting-room that they might be out of my sight at all
events.</p>
<p>After a while Price, remembering my former artifice, began to
believe that I was only pretending to be ill, in order to draw
Martin on, and then taking a certain liberty with me, as with a
child, she reproved me.</p>
<p>"If I were a lady I couldn't have the heart," she said, "I
really couldn't. It's all very well for us women, but men don't
understand such ways. They're only children, men are, when you come
to know them."</p>
<p>I began to look upon poor Price as a honeyed fiend sent by Satan
to seduce me, and to say the truth she sometimes acted up to the
character. One day she said:</p>
<p>"If I was tied to a man I didn't love, and who didn't love me,
and somebody else, worth ten of him was ready and waiting, I would
take the sweet with the bitter, I would. We women must follow our
hearts, and why shouldn't we?"</p>
<p>Then I scolded her dreadfully, asking if she had forgotten that
she was speaking to her mistress, and a married woman; but all the
while I knew that it was myself, not my maid, I was angry with, for
she had only been giving voice to the thoughts that were secretly
tormenting me.</p>
<p>I had been in bed about a week when Price came with a letter in
her hand and a look of triumph in her black eyes and said:</p>
<p>"There, my lady! What did I tell you? You've had it all your own
way and now you've driven him off. He has left the hotel and gone
to live on his ship."</p>
<p>This frightened me terribly, and partly for that reason I
ordered her out of the room, telling her she must leave me
altogether if she ever took such liberties again. But I'm sure she
saw me, as she was going through the door, take up Martin's letter,
which I had thrown on to the table, and press it to my lips.</p>
<p>The letter was of no consequence, it was merely to tell me that
he was going down to Tilbury for a few days, to take possession of
his old ship in the name of his company, but it said in a
postscript:</p>
<p>"If there's anything I can do for you, pass me the word and I'll
come up like quick-sticks."</p>
<p>"What can I do? What can I do?" I thought. Everything my heart
desired my soul condemned as sinful, and religion had done nothing
to liberate me from the pains of my guilty passion.</p>
<p>All this time my husband and Alma were busy with the gaieties of
the London season, which was then in full swing, with the houses in
Mayfair being ablaze every night, the blinds up and the windows
open to cool the overheated rooms in which men and women could be
seen dancing in closely-packed crowds.</p>
<p>One night, after Alma and my husband had gone to a reception in
Grosvenor Square, I had a sudden attack of heart-strain and had to
be put to bed, whereupon Price, who had realised that I was really
ill, told Hobson, my husband's valet, to go after his master and
bring him back immediately.</p>
<p>"It'll be all as one, but I'll go if you like," said Hobson.</p>
<p>In half an hour he came back with my husband's answer. "Send for
a doctor."</p>
<p>This put Price into a fever of mingled anger and perplexity, and
not knowing what else to do she telegraphed to Martin on his ship,
telling him that I was ill and asking what doctor she ought to call
in to see me.</p>
<p>Inside an hour a reply came not from Tilbury but from Portsmouth
saying:</p>
<p>"Call Doctor &mdash;&mdash; of Brook Street. Am coming up at
once."</p>
<p>All this I heard for the first time when Price, with another
triumphant look, came into my bedroom flourishing Martin's telegram
as something she had reason to be proud of.</p>
<p>"You don't mean to say that you telegraphed to Mr. Conrad?" I
said.</p>
<p>"Why <i>not?</i>" said Price. "When a lady is ill and her
husband pays no attention to her, and there's somebody else not far
off who would give his two eyes to save her a pain in her little
finger, what is a woman to do?"</p>
<p>I told her what she was <i>not</i> to do. She was not to call
the doctor under any circumstances, and when Martin came she was to
make it plain to him that she had acted on her own
responsibility.</p>
<p>Towards midnight he arrived, and Price brought him into my room
in a long ulster covered with dust. I blushed and trembled at sight
of him, for his face betrayed the strain and anxiety he had gone
through on my account, and when he smiled at seeing that I was not
as ill as he had thought, I was ashamed to the bottom of my
heart.</p>
<p>"You'll be sorry you've made such a long journey now that you
see there's so little amiss with me," I said.</p>
<p>"Sorry?" he said. "By the holy saints, I would take a longer one
every night of my life to see you looking so well at the end of
it."</p>
<p>His blue eyes were shining like the sun from behind a cloud, and
the cruellest looks could not have hurt me more.</p>
<p>I tried to keep my face from expressing the emotion I desired to
conceal, and asked if he had caught a train easily from Portsmouth,
seeing he had arrived so early.</p>
<p>"No. Oh no, there was no train up until eleven o'clock," he
said.</p>
<p>"Then how did you get here so soon?" I asked, and though he
would not tell me at first I got it out of him at last&mdash;he had
hired a motor-car and travelled the ninety miles to London in two
hours and a half.</p>
<p>That crushed me. I could not speak. I thought I should have
choked. Lying there with Martin at arm's length of me, I was afraid
of myself, and did not know what I might do next. But at last, with
a great effort to control myself, I took his hand and kissed it,
and then turned my face to the wall.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FIFTY_FIFTH_CHAPTER" id=
"FIFTY_FIFTH_CHAPTER"></a>FIFTY-FIFTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>That was the beginning of the end, and when, next day towards
noon, my husband came with drowsy eyes to make a kind of ungracious
apology, saying he supposed the doctor had been sent for, I
said:</p>
<p>"James, I want you to take me home."</p>
<p>"Home? You mean . . . Castle Raa?"</p>
<p>"Y-es."</p>
<p>He hesitated, and I began to plead with him, earnestly and
eagerly, not to deny me what I asked.</p>
<p>"Take me home, I beg, I pray."</p>
<p>At length, seeming to think I must be homesick, he said:</p>
<p>"Well, you know my views about that God-forsaken place, but the
season's nearly at an end, and I don't mind going back on one
condition&mdash;that you raise no objection to my inviting a few
friends to liven it up a bit?"</p>
<p>"It is your house," I said. "You must do as you please in
it."</p>
<p>"Very good; that's settled," he said, getting up to go. "And I
dare say it will do you no harm to be out of the way of all this
church-going and confessing to priests, who are always depressing
people even when they're not making mischief."</p>
<p>Hardly had my husband left me when Alma came into my
sitting-room in the most affectionate and insincere of her
moods.</p>
<p>"My poor, dear sweet child," she said. "If I'd had the least
idea you were feeling so badly I shouldn't have allowed Jimmy to
stay another minute at that tiresome reception. But how good it was
of Mr. Conrad to come all that way to see you! That's what I call
being a friend now!"</p>
<p>Then came the real object of her visit&mdash;I saw it
coming.</p>
<p>"I hear you're to have a house-party at Castle Raa. Jimmy's in
his room writing piles of invitations. He has asked me and I should
love to go, but of course I cannot do so without <i>you</i> wish
it. Do you?"</p>
<p>What could I say? What I <i>did</i> say I scarcely know. I only
know that at the next minute Alma's arms were round my neck, and
she was saying:</p>
<p>"You dear, sweet, unselfish little soul! Come let me kiss
you."</p>
<p>It was done. I had committed myself. After all what right had I
to raise myself on a moral pinnacle now? And what did it matter,
anyway? I was flying from the danger of my own infidelities, not to
save my husband from his.</p>
<p>Price had been in the room during this interview and when it was
over I was ashamed to look at her.</p>
<p>"I can't understand you, my lady; I really can't," she said.</p>
<p>Next day I wrote a little letter to Martin on the <i>Scotia</i>
telling him of our change of plans, but forbidding him to trouble
to come up to say good-bye, yet half hoping he would disregard my
injunction.</p>
<p>He did. Before I left my bedroom next morning I heard his voice
in the sitting-room talking to Price, who with considerable
emphasis was giving her views of Alma.</p>
<p>When I joined him I thought his face (which had grown to be very
powerful) looked hard and strained; but his voice was as soft as
ever while he said I was doing right in going home and that my
native air must be good for me.</p>
<p>"But what's this Price tells me&mdash;that Madame is going with
you?"</p>
<p>I tried to make light of that, but I broke down badly, for his
eyes were on me, and I could see that he thought I was concealing
the truth.</p>
<p>For some minutes he looked perplexed, as if trying to understand
how it came to pass that sickening, as he believed I was, at the
sight of my husband's infidelities I was yet carrying the
provocative cause of them away with me, and then he said again:</p>
<p>"I hate that woman. She's like a snake. I feel as if I want to
put my foot on it. I will, too, one of these days&mdash;bet your
life I will."</p>
<p>It hurt me to hide anything from him, but how could I tell him
that it was not from Alma I was flying but from himself?</p>
<p>When the day came for our departure I hoped I might get away
without seeing Martin again. We did get out of the hotel and into
the railway station, yet no sooner was I seated in the carriage
than (in the cruel war that was going on within me) I felt
dreadfully down that he was not there to see me off.</p>
<p>But at the very last moment, just as Alma with her spaniel under
her arm, and my husband with his terrier on a strap, were about to
step into the train, up came Martin like a gust of mountain
wind.</p>
<p>"Helloa!" he cried. "I shall be seeing you soon. Everything's
settled about the expedition. We're to sail the first week in
September, so as to get the summer months in the Antarctic. But
before that I must go over to the island to say good-bye to the old
folks, and I'll see you at your father's I suppose."</p>
<p>Then Alma gave my husband a significant glance and said:</p>
<p>"But, Mary, my love, wouldn't it be better for Mr. Conrad to
come to Castle Raa? You won't be able to go about very much.
Remember your delicate condition, you know."</p>
<p>"Of course, why of course," said my husband. "That's quite true,
and if Mr. Conrad will do me the honour to accept my hospitality
for a few days. . . ."</p>
<p>It was what I wanted above everything on earth, and yet I
said:</p>
<p>"No, no! It wouldn't be fair. Martin will be too busy at the
last moment."</p>
<p>But Martin himself jumped in eagerly with:</p>
<p>"Certainly! Delighted! Greatest pleasure in the world."</p>
<p>And then, while Alma gave my husband a look of arch triumph to
which he replied with a painful smile, Martin leaned over to me and
whispered"</p>
<p>"Hush! I want to! I must!" though what he meant by that I never
knew.</p>
<p>He continued to look at me with a tender expression until we
said good-bye; but after the carriage door had been closed and the
engine had throbbed, and the guard had whistled, I thought I had
never seen his strong face so stern as when the train moved from
the platform.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FIFTY_SIXTH_CHAPTER" id=
"FIFTY_SIXTH_CHAPTER"></a>FIFTY-SIXTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>We reached Ellan towards the close of the following day. It was
the height of the holiday season, and the island seemed to be
ablaze with lights.</p>
<p>Two motor-cars were waiting for us at the pier, and in a little
while we were driving out of Blackwater through congested masses of
people who were rambling aimlessly through the principal
streets.</p>
<p>Our way was across a stone bridge that crossed the harbour at
its inner end, and then up a hill that led to a headland
overlooking the sea. Within half an hour we drew up at a pair of
large gate posts which were much decayed and leaning heavily out of
the perpendicular.</p>
<p>The chauffeur of the first of our ears got down to open the
gate, and after it had clashed to behind us, we began to ascend a
very steep drive that was bordered by tall elm trees. It was now
almost dark, and the rooks, which had not yet gone off to the
mountains, were making their evening clamour.</p>
<p>"Well, my dear, you're at home at last, and much good may it do
you," said my husband.</p>
<p>I made no answer to this ungracious speech, but Alma was all
excitement.</p>
<p>"So this is Castle Raa! What a fascinating old place!" she said,
and as we drove through the park she reached out of the car to
catch a first glimpse of the broad terraces and winding ways to the
sea which had been reflected in her memory since she was a
child.</p>
<p>I felt no such anxiety. Never did a young bride approach the
home of her husband with less curiosity, but as our motor-car
toiled up the drive I could not help seeing the neglected condition
of the land, with boughs of trees lying where they had fallen in
the storms, as well as broken gates half off their hinges and
swinging to the wind.</p>
<p>The house itself, when we came in sight of it, was a large
castellated building with many lesser turrets and one lofty
octagonal tower, covered entirely with ivy, which, being apparently
unshorn for years, hung in long trailers down the walls, and gave
the whole pile the appearance of a huge moss-covered rock of the
sea planted on a promontory of the land.</p>
<p>As our car went thundering up to the great hall door nearly the
whole of the servants and some of the tenant farmers (under the
direction of the tall, sallow man who had been my husband's
guardian in former days, and was now his steward) were waiting to
welcome us, as well as Lady Margaret Anselm, who was still reserved
and haughty in her manner, though pleasant enough with me.</p>
<p>My husband nodded to all, shook hands with some, presented Alma
to his aunt as "one of Mary's old school friends," (a designation
which, as I could see, had gone ahead of her) and then we passed
into the house.</p>
<p>I found the inside corresponded with the outside in its
appearance of neglect and decay, the big square hall having rusty
and disjointed armour on its wainscotted walls and the mark of
water on the floor, which had come from a glass dome over the well
of the stairs, for it had rained while we were on the sea.</p>
<p>The drawing-room had faded curtains over the windows, faded
velvet on the square sofa and stiff chairs, faded carpets, faded
samplers, and faded embroidery on faded screens.</p>
<p>The dining-room (the sedate original of my father's rather
garish copy) was a panelled chamber, hung round with rubicund
portraits of the male O'Neills from the early ones of the family
who had been Lords of Ellan down to the "bad Lord Raa," who had
sworn at my grandmother on the high road.</p>
<p>I felt as if no woman could have made her home here for at least
a hundred years, and I thought the general atmosphere of the house
was that of the days when spendthrift noblemen, making the island a
refuge from debt, spent their days in gambling and their nights in
drinking bumpers from bowls of whiskey punch to the nameless
beauties they had left "in town."</p>
<p>They were all gone, all dead as the wood of the worm-eaten
wainscotting, but the sound of their noisy merry-making seemed to
cling to the rafters still, and as I went up to my rooms the broad
oaken staircase seemed to be creaking under their drunken
footsteps.</p>
<p>My own apartments, to which Lady Margaret conducted me, were on
the southern side of the house&mdash;a rather stuffy bedroom with
walls covered by a kind of pleated chintz, and a boudoir with a
stone balcony that had a flight of steps going down to a terrace of
the garden, which overlooked a glen and had a far view of the
sea.</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the landing outside (which was not
immediately off the great staircase though open to the view of it)
there was a similar suite of rooms which I thought might be my
husband's, but I was told they were kept for a guest.</p>
<p>Being left alone I had taken off my outer things and was
standing on my balcony, listening to the dull hum of the water in
the glen, the rustle of the trees above it, the surge of the sea on
the rocks below, the creaking of a rusty weathercock and the
striking of a court-yard clock, when I also heard the toot and
throb of another motor-car, and as soon as it came up I saw that it
contained Aunt Bridget in the half-moon bonnet and Betsy Beauty,
who was looking more than ever like a country belle.</p>
<p>When I went down to the drawing-room Lady Margaret was pouring
out tea for them, and at sight of me Aunt Bridget cried,</p>
<p>"Sakes alive, here she is herself!"</p>
<p>"But how pale and pinched and thin!" said Betsy Beauty.</p>
<p>"Nonsense, girl, that's only natural," said my Aunt Bridget,
with something like a wink; and then she went on to say that she
had just been telling her ladyship that if I felt lonely and a
little helpless on first coming home Betsy would be pleased to
visit me.</p>
<p>Before I could reply my husband came in, followed shortly by
Alma, who was presented as before, as "Mary's old school-fellow";
and then, while Betsy talked to Alma and my husband to his
kinswoman, Aunt Bridget, in an undertone, addressed herself to
me.</p>
<p>"You're that way, aren't you? . . . No? Goodness me, girl, your
father <i>will</i> be disappointed!"</p>
<p>Just then a third motor-car came throbbing up to the house, and
Betsy who was standing by the window cried:</p>
<p>"It's Uncle Daniel with Mr. Curphy and Nessy."</p>
<p>"Nessy, of course," said Aunt Bridget grumpily, and then she
told me in a confidential whisper that she was a much-injured woman
in regard to "that ungrateful step-daughter," who was making her
understand the words of Scripture about the pang that was sharper
than a serpent's tooth.</p>
<p>As the new-comers entered I saw that Nessy had developed an old
maid's idea of smartness, and that my father's lawyer was more than
ever like an over-fatted fish; but my father himself (except that
his hair was whiter) was the same man still, with the same heavy
step, the same loud voice and the same tempestuous gaiety.</p>
<p>"All here? Good! Glad to be home, I guess! Strong and well and
hearty, I suppose? . . . Yes, sir, yes! I'm middling myself, sir.
Middling, sir, middling!"</p>
<p>During these rugged salutations I saw that Alma, with the bad
manners of a certain type of society woman, looked on with a
slightly impertinent air of amused superiority, until she
encountered my father's masterful eyes, which nobody in the world
could withstand.</p>
<p>After a moment my father addressed himself to me.</p>
<p>"Well, gel," he said, taking me by the shoulders, as he did in
Rome, "you must have cut a dash in Egypt, I guess. Made the money
fly, didn't you? No matter! My gold was as good as anybody else's,
and I didn't grudge it. You'll clear me of that, anyway."</p>
<p>Then there was some general talk about our travels, about
affairs on the island (Mr. Curphy saying, with a laugh and a glance
in my direction, that things were going so well with my father that
if all his schemes matured he would have no need to wait for a
descendant to become the "uncrowned King of Ellan"), and finally
about Martin Conrad, whose great exploits had become known even in
his native country.</p>
<p>"Extraordinary! Extraordinary!" said my father. "I wouldn't have
believed it of him. I wouldn't really. Just a neighbour lad without
a penny at him. And now the world's trusting him with fifty
thousand pounds, they're telling me!"</p>
<p>"Well, many are called but few are chosen," said Mr. Curphy with
another laugh.</p>
<p>After that, and some broken conversation, Aunt Bridget expressed
a desire to see the house, as the evening was closing in and they
must soon be going back.</p>
<p>Lady Margaret thereupon took her, followed by the rest of us,
over the principal rooms of the Castle; and it was interesting to
see the awe with which she looked upon everything&mdash;her voice
dropping to a whisper in the dining-room. I remember, as if the
scene of carousing of the old roysterers had been a sort of
sanctuary.</p>
<p>My father, less impressed, saw nothing but a house in bad
repair, and turning to my husband, who had been obviously ill at
ease, he said:</p>
<p>"Go on like this much longer, son-in-law, and you'll be charging
two-pence a head to look at your ruins. Guess I must send my
architect over to see what he can do for you."</p>
<p>Then taking me aside he made his loud voice as low as he could
and said:</p>
<p>"What's this your Aunt Bridget tells me? Nine months married and
no sign yet? Tut, tut! That won't do, gel, that won't do."</p>
<p>I tried to tell him not to spend money on the Castle if he
intended to do so in expectation of an heir, but my heart was in my
mouth and what I really said I do not know. I only know that my
father looked at me for a moment as if perplexed, and then burst
into laughter.</p>
<p>"I see! I see!" he said. "It's a doctor you want. I must send
Conrad to put a sight on you. It'll be all right, gel, it'll be all
right! Your mother was like that when you were coming."</p>
<p>As we returned to the hall Betsy Beauty whispered that she was
surprised Mr. Eastcliff had married, but she heard from Madame that
we were to have a house-party soon, and she hoped I would not
forget her.</p>
<p>Then Aunt Bridget, who had been eyeing Alma darkly, asked me who
and what she was and where she came from, whereupon I (trying to
put the best face on things) explained that she was the daughter of
a rich New York banker. After that Aunt Bridget's countenance
cleared perceptibly and she said:</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, of course! I thought she had a quality toss with
her."</p>
<p>The two motor-cars had been drawn up to the door, and the two
parties had taken their seats in them when my father, looking about
him, said to my husband:</p>
<p>"Your garden is as rough as a thornbush, son-in-law. I must send
Tommy the Mate to smarten it up a bit. So long! So long!"</p>
<p>At the next moment they were gone, and I was looking longingly
after them. God knows my father's house had never been more than a
stepmother's home to me, but at that moment I yearned to return to
it and felt like a child who was being left behind at school.</p>
<p>What had I gained, by running away from London? Nothing at all.
Already I knew I had brought my hopeless passion with me.</p>
<p>And now I was alone.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FIFTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"FIFTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER"></a>FIFTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Next day Lady Margaret came to my room to say good-bye, telling
me she had only stayed at Castle Raa to keep house and make ready
for me, and must now return to her own home, which was in
London.</p>
<p>I was sorry, for my heart had warmed to her, and when I stood at
the door and saw her drive off with my husband to catch the
afternoon steamer, I felt I had lost both sympathy and
protection.</p>
<p>Alma's feelings were less troubled, and as we turned back into
the house I could see that she was saying to herself:</p>
<p>"Thank goodness, <i>she's</i> gone away."</p>
<p>A day or two later Doctor Conrad came, according to my father's
instructions, and I was glad to see his close-cropped iron-grey
head coming up the stairs towards my room.</p>
<p>Naturally our first conversation was about Martin, who had
written to tell his parents of our meeting in London and to
announce his intended visit. It was all very exciting, and now his
mother was working morning and night at the old cottage, to prepare
for the arrival of her son. Such scrubbing and scouring! Such
taking up of carpets and laying them down again, as if the darling
old thing were expecting a prince!</p>
<p>"It ought to be Sunny Lodge indeed before she's done with it,"
said the Doctor.</p>
<p>"I'm sure it will," I said. "It always was, and it always will
be."</p>
<p>"And how are we ourselves," said the doctor. "A little below
par, eh? Any sickness? No? Nausea? No? Headache and a feeling of
lassitude, then? No?"</p>
<p>After other questions and tests, the old doctor was looking
puzzled, when, not finding it in my heart to keep him in the dark
any longer, I told him there was nothing amiss with my health, but
I was unhappy and had been so since the time of my marriage.</p>
<p>"I see," he said. "It's your mind and not your body that is
sick?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I'll speak to Father Dan," he said. "Good-bye! God bless
you!"</p>
<p>Less than half an hour after he had gone, Alma came to me in her
softest mode, saying the doctor had said I was suffering from
extreme nervous exhaustion and ought to be kept from worries and
anxieties of every kind.</p>
<p>"So if there's anything I can do while I'm here, dearest, . . .
such as looking after the house and the servants. . . . No, no,
don't deny me; it will be a pleasure, I assure you. . . . So we'll
say that's settled, shall we? . . . You dear, sweet darling
creature!"</p>
<p>I was too much out of heart to care what happened, but inside
two days I realised that Alma had taken possession of the house,
and was ordering and controlling everything.</p>
<p>Apparently this pleased such of the servants as had anything to
gain by it&mdash;the housekeeper in particular&mdash;for Alma was
no skinflint and she was making my husband's money flow like water,
but it was less agreeable to my maid, who said:</p>
<p>"This is a nice place to be sure, where the mistress takes no
interest in anything, and the guest walks over everybody. She'll
walk over the mistress herself before long&mdash;mark my word but
she will."</p>
<p>It would be about a week after our arrival at Castle Raa that
Price came to my room to say that a priest was asking for me, and
he was such a strange-looking thing that she was puzzled to know if
his face was that of a child, a woman or a dear old man.</p>
<p>I knew in a moment it must be Father Dan, so I went flying
downstairs and found him in the hall, wearing the same sack coat
(or so it seemed) as when I was a child and made cupboards of its
vertical pockets, carrying the same funny little bag which he had
taken to Rome and used for his surplice at funerals, and mopping
his forehead and flicking his boots with a red print handkerchief,
for the day was hot and the roads were dusty.</p>
<p>He was as glad to see me as I to see him, and when I asked if he
would have tea, he said Yes, for he had walked all the way from the
Presbytery, after fasting the day before; and when I asked if he
would not stay overnight he said Yes to that, too, "if it would not
be troublesome and inconvenient."</p>
<p>So I took his bag and gave it to a maid, telling her to take it
to the guest's room on my landing, and to bring tea to my boudoir
immediately.</p>
<p>But hardly had I taken him upstairs and we had got seated in my
private room, when the maid knocked at the door to say that the
housekeeper wished to speak with me, and on going out, and closing
the door behind me, I found her on the landing, a prim little
flinty person with quick eyes, thin lips and an upward lift of her
head.</p>
<p>"Sorry, my lady, but it won't be convenient for his reverence to
stay in the house to-night," she said.</p>
<p>"Why so?" I said.</p>
<p>"Because Madame has ordered all the rooms to be got ready for
the house-party, and this one," (pointing to the guest's room
opposite) "is prepared for Mr. and Mrs. Eastcliff, and we don't
know how soon they may arrive."</p>
<p>I felt myself flushing up to the eyes at the woman's impudence,
and it added to my anger that Alma herself was standing at the head
of the stairs, looking on and listening. So with a little spurt of
injured pride I turned severely on the one while really speaking to
the other, and said:</p>
<p>"Be good enough to make this room ready for his reverence
without one moment's delay, and please remember for the future,
that I am mistress in this house, and your duty is to obey me and
nobody else whatever."</p>
<p>As I said this and turned back to my boudoir, I saw that Alma's
deep eyes had a sullen look, and I felt that she meant to square
accounts with me some day; but what she did was done at once, for
going downstairs (as I afterwards heard from Price) she met my
husband in the hall, where, woman-like, she opened her battery upon
him at his weakest spot, saying:</p>
<p>"Oh, I didn't know your wife was priest-ridden."</p>
<p>"Priest-ridden?"</p>
<p>"Precisely," and then followed an explanation of what had
happened, with astonishing embellishments which made my husband
pale with fury.</p>
<p>Meantime I was alone with Father Dan in my room, and while I
poured out his tea and served him with bread and butter, he talked
first about Martin (as everybody seemed to do when speaking to me),
saying:</p>
<p>"He was always my golden-headed boy, and it's a mighty proud man
I am entirely to hear the good news of him."</p>
<p>More of the same kind there was, all music to my ears, and then
Father Dan came to closer quarters, saying Doctor Conrad had
dropped a hint that I was not very happy.</p>
<p>"Tell your old priest everything, my child, and if there is
anything he can do. . . ."</p>
<p>Without waiting for more words I sank to my knees at his feet,
and poured out all my troubles&mdash;telling him my marriage had
been a failure; that the sanctifying grace which he had foretold as
the result of the sacrament of holy wedlock had not come to pass;
that not only did I not love my husband, but my husband loved
another woman, who was living here with us in this very house.</p>
<p>Father Dan was dreadfully distressed. More than once while I was
speaking he crossed himself and said, "Lord and His Holy Mother
love us;" and when I came to an end he began to reproach himself
for everything, saying that he ought to have known that our lad
(meaning Martin) did not write those terrible letters without being
certain they were true, and that from the first day my husband came
to our parish the sun had been darkened by his shadow.</p>
<p>"But take care," he said. "I've told nobody about the compact we
made with your husband&mdash;nobody but our Blessed Lady
herself&mdash;and you mustn't think of that as a way out of your
marriage. No, nor of any other way, no matter what, which the
world, and the children of the world, may talk about."</p>
<p>"But I can't bear it, I can't bear it," I cried.</p>
<p>"Hush! Hush! Don't say that, my daughter. Think of it as one of
the misfortunes of life which we all have to suffer. How many poor
women have to bear the sickness and poverty, not to speak of the
drunkenness and death, of their husbands! Do they think they have a
right to run away from all that&mdash;to break the sacred vows of
their marriage on account of it? No, my child, no, and neither must
you. Some day it will all come right. You'll see it will. And
meantime by the memory of your mother&mdash;that blessed saint whom
the Lord has made one of his own. . . ."</p>
<p>"Then what can I do?"</p>
<p>"Pray, my child, pray for strength to bear your trials and to
resist all temptation. Say a rosary for the Blessed Virgin every
morning before breaking your fast. I'll say a rosary, too. You'll
see yet this is only God's love for you, and you'll welcome His
holy will."</p>
<p>While my dear father and friend was counselling me so I heard my
husband speaking in his loud, grating tones on the landing outside,
and before I could rise from my knees he had burst open the door
and entered the room.</p>
<p>His face was deadly white and he was like a man out of his right
mind.</p>
<p>"Mary," he said, looking down at me where I knelt with my hands
crossed on my bosom, "when did I give you permission to introduce a
priest into my house? Isn't it enough for a man to have a wife who
is a Catholic without having the church and its ministers shunted
into his home without his permission?"</p>
<p>I was so taken aback by this furious assault that at first I
could not speak, but Father Dan interposed to defend me, saying
with beautiful patience, that his visit had been quite unexpected
on my part, and that I had asked him to stay overnight only because
he was an old man, and had had a long walk from his parish.</p>
<p>"I'm much obliged to your reverence," said my husband, who was
quivering with fury, "but my wife is perfectly capable of answering
for herself without your assistance, and as for your parish you
would have done better to stay there instead of coming to meddle in
this one."</p>
<p>"Aren't you measuring me by your own yard, sir?" said Father
Dan, and at that straight thrust my husband broke into ungovernable
rage.</p>
<p>"Everybody knows what a Popish priest is," he said. "A
meddlesome busybody who pokes his nose into other men's secrets.
But priest or no priest, I'll have no man coming to my house to
make mischief between husband and wife."</p>
<p>"Are you sure," said Father Dan, "that some woman isn't in your
house already, making mischief between wife and husband?"</p>
<p>That thrust too went home. My husband looked at me with flashing
eyes and then said:</p>
<p>"As I thought! You've been sent for to help my wife to make a
great to-do of her imaginary grievances. You're to stay in the
house too, and before long we'll have you setting up as master here
and giving orders to my servants! But not if I know it! . . . Your
reverence, if you have any respect for your penitent, you'll please
be good enough to leave my wife to <i>my</i> protection."</p>
<p>I saw that Father Dan had to gulp down his gathering anger, but
he only said:</p>
<p>"Say no more, my lord. No true priest ever comes between a man
and the wife whom God has given him. It's his business to unite
people, not to put them apart. As for this dear child, I have loved
her since she was an infant in arms, and never so much as at the
present speaking, so I don't need to learn my duty from one who
appears to care no more for her than for the rind of a lemon. I'll
go, sir," said the old man, drawing himself up like a wounded lion,
"but it's not to your protection I leave her&mdash;it's to that of
God's blessed and holy love and will."</p>
<p>My husband had gone before the last words were spoken, but I
think they must have followed him as he went lunging down the
stairs.</p>
<p>During this humiliating scene a hot flush of shame had come to
my cheeks and I wanted to tell Father Dan not to let it grieve him,
but I could do nothing but stoop and kiss his hand.</p>
<p>Meantime two or three of the servants had gathered on the
landing at the sound of my husband's voice, and among them was the
flinty housekeeper holding the Father's little bag, and she gave it
back to him as he passed her.</p>
<p>Then, all being over, the woman came into my room, with an
expression of victorious mischief in her eyes and said:</p>
<p>"Your ladyship had better have listened to them as knows, you
see."</p>
<p>I was too benumbed by that cruel stroke to reply, but Price said
enough for both of us.</p>
<p>"If them as knows," she said, "don't get out of this room inside
two seconds they'll get their ugly faces slapped."</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>I thought I had reached the end of my power of endurance, and
that night, before going to bed, while my maid was taking down my
hair, and I was thinking of Martin and asking myself if I should
put up with my husband's brutalities any longer, I heard her
say:</p>
<p>"If I were a lady married to the wrong man, I'd have the right
one if I had to go through the divorce court for him."</p>
<p>Now that was so exactly the thought that was running riot in my
own tormented mind, that I flew at her like a wild cat, asking her
how she dared to say anything so abominably wicked, and telling her
to take her notice there and then.</p>
<p>But hardly had she left the room, when my heart was in my mouth
again, and I was trembling with fear lest she should take me at my
word and then the last of my friends would be gone.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="FIFTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER" id=
"FIFTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER"></a>FIFTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Within the next few days the house-party arrived. There would be
twenty of them at least, not counting valets and ladies' maids, so
that large as Castle Raa was the house was full.</p>
<p>They were about equally divided as to sex and belonged chiefly
to my husband's class, but they included Mr. Eastcliff's beautiful
wife, Camilla, and Alma's mother, who, much to Alma's chagrin, had
insisted upon being invited.</p>
<p>My husband required me to receive them, and I did so, though I
was only their nominal hostess, and they knew it and treated me
accordingly.</p>
<p>I should be ashamed to speak of the petty slights they put upon
me, how they consulted Alma in my presence and otherwise wounded my
pride as a woman by showing me that I had lost my own place in my
husband's house.</p>
<p>I know there are people of the same class who are kind and
considerate, guileless and pure, the true nobility of their
country&mdash;women who are devoted to their homes and children,
and men who spend their wealth and strength for the public
good&mdash;but my husband's friends were not of that kind.</p>
<p>They were vain and proud, selfish, self-indulgent, thoroughly
insincere, utterly ill-mannered, shockingly ill-informed,
astonishingly ill-educated (capable of speaking several languages
but incapable of saying a sensible word in any of them), living and
flourishing in the world without religion, without morality, and
(if it is not a cant phrase to use) without God.</p>
<p>What their conduct was when out shooting, picnicking, driving,
riding, motoring, and yachting (for Mr. Eastcliff had arrived in
his yacht, which was lying at anchor in the port below the glen), I
do not know, for "doctor's orders" were Alma's excuse for not
asking me to accompany them.</p>
<p>But at night they played bridge (their most innocent amusement),
gambled and drank, banged the piano, danced "Grizzly Bears," sang
duets from the latest musical comedies, and then ransacked the
empty houses of their idle heads for other means of killing the one
enemy of their existence&mdash;Time.</p>
<p>Sometimes they would give entertainments in honour of their
dogs, when all the animals of all the guests (there seemed to be a
whole kennel of them) would be dressed up in coats of silk and
satin with pockets and pocket-handkerchiefs, and then led
downstairs to the drawing-room, where Alma's wheezy spaniel and my
husband's peevish terrier were supposed to receive them.</p>
<p>Sometimes they would give "freak dinners," when the guests
themselves would be dressed up, the men in women's clothes, the
women in men's, the male imitating the piping treble of the female
voices, and the female the over-vowelled slang of the male, until,
tiring of this foolishness, they would end up by flinging the food
at the pictures on the walls, the usual pellet being softened bread
and the favourite target the noses in the family portraits, which,
hit and covered with a sprawling mess, looked so ridiculous as to
provoke screams of laughter.</p>
<p>The talk at table was generally of horses and dogs, but
sometimes it was of love, courtship and marriage, including
conjugal fidelity, which was a favourite subject of ridicule, with
both the women and the men.</p>
<p>Thus my husband would begin by saying (he often said it in my
hearing) that once upon a time men took their wives as they took
their horses, on trial for a year and a day, and "really with some
women there was something to say for the old custom."</p>
<p>Then Mr. Vivian would remark that it was "a jolly good idea, by
Jove," and if he "ever married, by the Lord that's just what he
would do."</p>
<p>Then Mr. Eastcliff would say that it was a ridiculous
superstition that a woman should have her husband all to herself,
"as if he were a kind of toothbrush which she could not share with
anybody else," and somebody would add that she might as reasonably
want her dentist or her hairdresser to be kept for her own use
only.</p>
<p>After that the ladies, not to be left behind, would join in the
off-hand rattle, and one of them would give it as her opinion that
a wife might have an incorrigibly unfaithful husband, and yet be
well off.</p>
<p>"Ugh!" said Alma one night, shrugging her shoulders. "Think of a
poor woman being tied for life to an entirely faithful
husband!"</p>
<p>"I adore the kind of man who goes to the deuce for a
woman&mdash;Parnell, and Gambetta and Boulanger and that sort,"
said a "smart" girl of three or four-and-twenty, whereupon Camilla
Eastcliff (she was a Russian) cried:</p>
<p>"That's vhy the co-respondents in your divorce courts are so
sharming. They're like the villayns in the plays&mdash;always so
dee-lightfully vicked."</p>
<p>Oh, the sickening horror of it all! Whether it was really moral
corruption or only affectation and pose, it seemed equally
shocking, and though I bore as much of it as I could with a
cheerful face, I escaped as often as possible to the clean
atmosphere of my own room.</p>
<p>But even there I was not always allowed to be alone, for Alma's
mother frequently followed me. She was a plump little person in a
profuse ornamentation of diamond rings and brooches, with little or
no education, and a reputation for saying risky things in
blundering French whereof the principal humour lay in the
uncertainty as to whether she knew their meaning or not.</p>
<p>Nevertheless she was the only good-hearted woman in the house,
and I really believe she thought she was doing a kind act in
keeping me company. But oh, how I suffered from her long accounts
of her former "visits" to my house, whereby I learned, without
wishing to, what her origin had been (the daughter of a London
postman); what position she had held in Castle Raa in her winsome
and reckless youth (one that need not be defined); how she had met
her husband in New York and he had married her to save the
reputation of his child; and finally how the American ladies of
society had refused to receive her, and she had vowed to be
revenged on them by marrying Alma to the highest title in Europe
that could be bought with money.</p>
<p>"I was just like your father, my dear. I never did no manner of
harm to those people. They used to think I thought myself better
blood nor they were, but I never thought no such thing, I assure
you. Only when they turned nasty after my marriage I made up my
mind&mdash;just as your father did&mdash;as Alma should marry a
bigger husband nor any of them, even if he wasn't worth a dime and
'adn't a 'air on 'is 'ead."</p>
<p>But even these revelations about herself were less humiliating
than her sympathy with me, which implied that I was not fitted to
be mistress of a noble house&mdash;how could it be expected of
me?&mdash;whereas Alma was just as if she had been born to it, and
therefore it was lucky for me that I had her there to show me how
to do things.</p>
<p>"Alma's gotten such <i>ton!</i> Such distangy manners!" she
would say.</p>
<p>The effect of all this was to make me feel, as I had never felt
before, the intolerable nature of the yoke I was living under. When
I looked into the future and saw nothing before me but years of
this ignoble bondage, I told myself that nothing&mdash;no sacrament
or contract, no law of church or state&mdash;could make me endure
it.</p>
<p>From day to day my maid came to me with insidious hints about
Alma and my husband. I found myself listening to them. I also found
myself refreshing my memory of the hideous scene in Paris, and
wondering why I had condoned the offence by staying an hour longer
under my husband's protection.</p>
<p>And then there was always another force at work within
me&mdash;my own secret passion. Though sometimes I felt myself to
be a wretched sinner and thought the burden I had to bear was
heaven's punishment for my guilty love, at other times my whole
soul rose in revolt, and I cried out not merely for separation from
my husband but for absolute sundering.</p>
<p>Twice during the painful period of the house-party I heard from
Martin. His first letter was full of accounts of the far-reaching
work of his expedition&mdash;the engaging of engineers,
electricians, geologists and masons, and the shipping of great
stores of wireless apparatus&mdash;for his spirits seemed to be
high, and life was full of good things for him.</p>
<p>His second letter told me that everything was finished, and he
was to visit the island the next week, going first to "the old
folks" and coming to me for a few days immediately before setting
sail.</p>
<p>That brought matters to a head, and compelled me to take
action.</p>
<p>It may have been weak of me, but not wanting a repetition of the
scene with Father Dan, (knowing well that Martin would not bear it
with the same patience) I sent the second letter to Alma, asking if
the arrangement would be agreeable. She returned it with the
endorsement (scribbled in pencil across the face), "Certainly;
anything to please <i>you</i>, dear."</p>
<p>I submitted even to that. Perhaps I was a poor-spirited thing,
wanting in proper pride, but I had a feeling that it was not worth
while to waste myself in little squibs of temper, because an
eruption was coming (I was sure of that) in which Martin would be
concerned on my side, and then everybody and everything would be
swept out of the path of my life for ever.</p>
<p>Martin came. In due course I read in the insular newspapers of
his arrival on the island&mdash;how the people had turned out in
crowds to cheer him at the pier, and how, on reaching our own
village the neighbours (I knew the names of all of them) had met
him at the railway station and taken him to his mother's house, and
then lighted fires on the mountains for his welcome home.</p>
<p>It cut me to the heart's core to think of Martin amid thrilling
scenes like those while I was here among degrading scenes like
these. My love for Martin was now like a wound and I resolved that,
come what might, before he reached Castle Raa I should liberate
myself from the thraldom of my false position.</p>
<p>Father Dan's counsels had faded away by this time. Though I had
prayed for strength to bear my burden there had been no result, and
one morning, standing before the figure of the Virgin in my
bedroom, I felt an impulse to blow out her lamp and never to light
it again.</p>
<p>The end of it all was that I determined to see the Bishop and my
father's advocate, Mr. Curphy, and perhaps my father himself, that
I might know one way or the other where I was, and what was to
become of me. But how to do this I could not see, having a houseful
of people who were nominally my guests.</p>
<p>Fortune&mdash;ill-fortune&mdash;favoured me. News came that my
father had suddenly fallen ill of some ailment that puzzled the
doctors, and making this my reason and excuse I spoke to my
husband, asking if I might go home for two or three days.</p>
<p>"Why not?" he said, in the tone of one who meant, "Who's keeping
you?"</p>
<p>Then in my weakness I spoke to Alma, who answered:</p>
<p>"Certainly, my sweet girl. We shall miss you <i>dreadfully</i>,
but it's your duty. And then you'll see that <i>dear</i> Mr. . . .
What d'ye callum?"</p>
<p>Finally, feeling myself a poor, pitiful hypocrite, I apologised
for my going away to the guests also, and they looked as if they
might say: "We'll survive it, perhaps."</p>
<p>The night before my departure my maid said:</p>
<p>"Perhaps your ladyship has forgotten that my time's up, but I'll
stay until you return if you want me to."</p>
<p>I asked her if she would like to stay with me altogether and she
said:</p>
<p>"Indeed I should, my lady. Any woman would like to stay with a
good mistress, if she <i>is</i> a little quick sometimes. And if
you don't want me to go to your father's I may be of some use to
you here before you come back again."</p>
<p>I saw that her mind was still running on divorce, but I did not
reprove her now, for mine was turning in the same direction.</p>
<p>Next morning most of the guests came to the hail door to see me
off, and they gave me a shower of indulgent smiles as the motor-car
moved away.</p>

<h2><a name="FIFTY_NINTH_CHAPTER" id=
"FIFTY_NINTH_CHAPTER"></a>FIFTY-NINTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Before going to my father's house I went to the Bishop's.
Bishop's Court is at the other side of the island, and it was noon
before I drove under its tall elm trees, in which a vast concourse
of crows seemed to be holding a sort of general congress.</p>
<p>The Bishop was then at his luncheon, and after luncheon (so his
liveried servant told me) he usually took a siesta. I have always
thought it was unfortunate for my interview that it came between
his food and his sleep.</p>
<p>The little reception-room into which I was shown was
luxuriously, not to say gorgeously, appointed, with easy chairs and
sofas, a large portrait of the Pope, signed by the Holy Father
himself, and a number of pictures of great people of all
kinds&mdash;dukes, marquises, lords, counts&mdash;as well as
photographs of fashionable ladies in low dress inscribed in several
languages to "My dear Father in God the Lord Bishop of Ellan."</p>
<p>The Bishop came to me after a few minutes, smiling and
apparently at peace with all the world. Except that he wore a
biretta he was dressed&mdash;as in Rome&mdash;in his long black
soutane with its innumerable buttons, his silver-buckled shoes, his
heavy gold chain and jewelled cross.</p>
<p>He welcomed me in his smooth and suave manner, asking if he
could offer me a little refreshment; but, too full of my mission to
think of eating and drinking, I plunged immediately into the object
of my visit.</p>
<p>"Monsignor," I said, "I am in great trouble. It is about my
marriage."</p>
<p>The smile was smitten away from the Bishop's face by this
announcement.</p>
<p>"I am sorry," he said. "Nothing serious, I trust?"</p>
<p>I told him it was very serious, and straightway I began on the
spiritual part of my grievance&mdash;that my husband did not love
me, that he loved another woman, that the sacred sacrament of my
marriage. . . .</p>
<p>"Wait," said the Bishop, and he rose to close the window, for
the clamour of the crows was deafening&mdash;a trial must have been
going on in the trees. Returning to his seat he said:</p>
<p>"Dear lady, you must understand that there is one offence, and
only one, which in all Christian countries and civilised
communities is considered sufficient to constitute a real and
tangible grievance. Have you any evidence of that?"</p>
<p>I knew what he meant and I felt myself colouring to the roots of
my hair. But gulping down my shame I recounted the story of the
scene in Paris and gave a report of my maid's charges and
surmises.</p>
<p>"Humph!" said the Bishop, and I saw in a moment that he was
going to belittle my proofs.</p>
<p>"Little or no evidence of your own, apparently. Chiefly that of
your maid. And ladies' maids are notorious mischief-makers."</p>
<p>"But it's true," I said. "My husband will not deny it. He
cannot."</p>
<p>"So far as I am able to observe what passes in the world," said
the Bishop, "men in such circumstances always can and do deny
it."</p>
<p>I felt my hands growing moist under my gloves. I thought the
Bishop was trying to be blind to what he did not wish to see.</p>
<p>"But I'm right, I'm sure I'm right," I said.</p>
<p>"Well, assuming you <i>are</i> right, what is it, dear lady,
that you wish me to do?"</p>
<p>For some minutes I felt like a fool, but I stammered out at
length that I had come for his direction and to learn what relief
the Church could give me.</p>
<p>"H'm!" said the Bishop, and then crossing one leg over the
other, and fumbling the silver buckle of his shoe, he said:</p>
<p>"The Church, dear lady, does indeed provide alleviation in cases
of dire necessity. It provides the relief of
separation&mdash;always deploring the necessity and hoping for
ultimate reconciliation. But to sanction the separation of a wife
from her husband because&mdash;pardon me, I do not say this is your
case&mdash;she finds that he does not please her, or
because&mdash;again I do not say this is your case&mdash;she
fancies that somebody else pleases her better. . . ."</p>
<p>"Monsignor," I said, feeling hot and dizzy, "we need not discuss
separation. I am thinking of something much more serious."</p>
<p>Never shall I forget the expression of the Bishop's face. He
looked aghast.</p>
<p>"My good lady, surely you are not thinking of divorce?"</p>
<p>I think my head must have dropped as in silent assent, for in a
peremptory and condemnatory manner the Bishop took me to task,
asking if I did not know that the Catholic Church did not recognise
divorce under any circumstances, and if I had forgotten what the
Holy Father himself (pointing up to the portrait) had said to
me&mdash;that when I entered into the solemn contract of holy
matrimony I was to do so in the full consciousness that it could
not be broken but by death.</p>
<p>"The love in which husband and wife contract to hold each other
in holy wedlock is typified by the love of Christ for His Church,
and as the one can never be broken, neither can the other."</p>
<p>"But my husband does not love me," I said. "Neither do I love
him, and therefore the contract between us is broken already."</p>
<p>The Bishop was very severe with me for this, telling me that as
a good child of the Church, I must never, never say that again, for
though marriage was a contract it differed from all other contracts
whatsoever.</p>
<p>"When you married your husband, dear lady, you were bound to him
not by your own act alone, but by a mysterious power from which
neither of you can ever free yourself. The power that united you
was God, and whom God has joined together no man may put
asunder."</p>
<p>I felt my head drooping. The Bishop was saying what I had always
been taught, though in the torment of my trouble and the fierce
fire of my temptation I had forgotten it.</p>
<p>"The civil law <i>might</i> divorce you," continued the Bishop.
"I don't know&mdash;I can say nothing about that. But it would have
<i>no right</i> to do so because the law can have no right to undo
what God Himself has done."</p>
<p>Oh, it was cruel! I felt as if the future of my life were
darkening before me&mdash;as if the iron bars of a prison were
closing upon me, and fetters were being fixed on every limb.</p>
<p>"But even if the civil law <i>could</i> and <i>would</i> divorce
you," said the Bishop, "think of the injury you would be inflicting
on the Church. Yours was what is called a mixed marriage, and the
Church does not favour such marriages, but it consented in this
case, and why? Because it hoped to bring back an erring family in a
second generation to the fold of the faith. Yet what would you be
doing? Without waiting for a second generation you would he
defeating its purpose."</p>
<p>A cold chill seemed to creep to my heart at these words. Was it
the lost opportunity the Bishop was thinking of, instead of the
suffering woman with her bruised and bleeding soul?</p>
<p>I rose to go. The Bishop rose with me, and began to counsel
forgiveness.</p>
<p>"Even if you <i>have</i> suffered injury, dear lady," he
said&mdash;"I don't say you haven't&mdash;isn't it possible to
forgive? Remember, forgiveness is a divine virtue, enjoined on us
all, and especially on a woman towards the man she has married.
Only think! How many women have to practise it&mdash;every day, all
the world over!"</p>
<p>"Ah, well!" I said, and walked to the door.</p>
<p>The Bishop walked with me, urging me, as a good daughter of the
Church, to live at peace with my husband, whatever his faults, and
when my children came (as please God they would) to "instil into
them the true faith with all a mother's art, a mother's
tenderness," so that the object of my marriage might be fulfilled,
and a good Catholic become the heir to Castle Raa.</p>
<p>"So the Church can do nothing for me?" I said.</p>
<p>"Nothing but pray, dear lady," said the Bishop.</p>
<p>When I left him my heart was in fierce rebellion; and, since the
Church could do nothing, I determined to see if the law could do
anything, so I ordered my chauffeur to drive to the house of my
father's advocate at Holmtown.</p>
<p>The trial in the trees was over by this time, and a dead crow
tumbled from one of the tall elms as we passed out of the
grounds.</p>
<p>Holmtown is a little city on the face of our bleak west coast,
dominated by a broad stretch of sea, and having the sound of the
waves always rumbling over it. Mr. Curphy's house faced the shore
and his office was an upper room plainly furnished with a writing
desk, a deal table, laden with law books and foolscap papers, a
stiff arm-chair, covered with American leather, three or four
coloured engravings of judges in red and ermine, a photograph of
the lawyer himself in wig and gown, an illuminated certificate of
his membership of a legal society, and a number of lacquered tin
boxes, each inscribed with the name of a client&mdash;the largest
box bearing the name of "Daniel O'Neill."</p>
<p>My father's advocate received me with his usual bland smile,
gave me his clammy fat hand, put me to sit in the arm-chair, hoped
my unexpected visit did not presage worse news from the Big house,
and finally asked me what he could do.</p>
<p>I told my story over again, omitting my sentimental grievances
and coming quickly, and with less delicacy, to the grosser facts of
my husband's infidelity.</p>
<p>The lawyer listened with his head aside, his eyes looking out on
the sea and his white fingers combing his long brown beard, and
before I had finished I could see that he too, like the Bishop, had
determined to see nothing.</p>
<p>"You may be right," he began. . . .</p>
<p>"I <i>am</i> right!" I answered.</p>
<p>"But even if you <i>are</i>, I am bound to tell you that
adultery is not enough of itself as a ground for divorce."</p>
<p>"Not enough?"</p>
<p>"If you were a man it would be, but being a woman you must
establish cruelty as well."</p>
<p>"Cruelty? Isn't it all cruelty?" I asked.</p>
<p>"In the human sense, yes; in the legal sense, no," answered the
lawyer.</p>
<p>And then he proceeded to explain to me that in this country,
unlike some others, before a woman could obtain a divorce from her
husband she had to prove that he had not only been unfaithful to
her, but that he had used violence to her, struck her in the face
perhaps, threatened her or endangered her life or health.</p>
<p>"Your husband hasn't done that, has he? No? I thought not. After
all he's a gentleman. Therefore there is only one other ground on
which you could establish a right to divorce, namely desertion, and
your husband is not likely to run away. In fact, he couldn't. It
isn't to his interest. We've seen to all that&mdash;<i>here</i>,"
and smiling again, the lawyer patted the top of the lacquered box
that bore my father's name.</p>
<p>I was dumbfounded. Even more degrading than the fetters whereby
the Church bound me to my marriage were the terms on which the law
would release me.</p>
<p>"But assuming that you <i>could</i> obtain a divorce," said the
lawyer, "what good would it do you? You would have to relinquish
your title."</p>
<p>"I care nothing about my title," I replied.</p>
<p>"And your position."</p>
<p>"I care nothing about that either."</p>
<p>"Come, come," said the lawyer, patting my arm as if I had been
an angry child on the verge of tears. "Don't let a fit of pique or
spleen break up a marriage that is so suitable from the points of
property and position. And then think of your good father. Why did
he spend all that money in setting a ruined house on its legs
again? That he might carry on his name in a noble family, and
through your children, and your children's children. . . ."</p>
<p>"Then the law can do nothing for me?" I said, feeling sick and
sore.</p>
<p>"Sorry, very sorry, but under present conditions, as far as I
can yet see, nothing," said the lawyer.</p>
<p>"Good-day, sir," I said, and before he could have known what I
was doing I had leapt up, left the room, and was hurrying
downstairs.</p>
<p>My heart was in still fiercer rebellion now. I would go home. I
would appeal to my father. Hard as he had always been with me he
was at least a man, not a cold abstraction, like the Church and the
law, without bowels of compassion or sense of human suffering.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SIXTIETH_CHAPTER" id="SIXTIETH_CHAPTER"></a>SIXTIETH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Although I had sent word that I was coming home, there was no
one to welcome me when I arrived.</p>
<p>Aunt Bridget was out shopping, and Betsy Beauty (in the sulks
with me, as I afterwards heard, for not asking her to the
house-party) had run upstairs on hearing our horn, so I went direct
to my father's room.</p>
<p>Nessy MacLeod answered my knock, but instead of opening the door
to let me in, she slid out like a cat and closed it behind her.
Never had her ungainly figure, her irregular features, and her red
head seemed to me so repugnant. I saw at once that she was giving
herself the airs of housekeeper, and I noticed that she was wearing
the bunch of keys which used to dangle from Aunt Bridget's waist
when I was a child.</p>
<p>"Your father is ill," she said.</p>
<p>I told her I knew that, and it was one of the reasons I was
there.</p>
<p>"Seriously ill," she said, standing with her back to the door.
"The doctor says he is to be kept perfectly quiet."</p>
<p>Indignant at the effrontery of the woman who was trying to keep
me out of my father's room, I said:</p>
<p>"Let me pass, please."</p>
<p>"S'sh! He has a temperature, and I don't choose that anybody
shall disturb him to-day."</p>
<p>"Let me pass," I repeated, and I must have pitched my voice so
high that my father heard it.</p>
<p>"Is that Mary?" came from the other side of the door, whereupon
Nessy beat a retreat, and at the next moment I was in my father's
room.</p>
<p>His massive and powerful head was propped up with pillows in the
camp-bed which was all he ever slept on, and he was looking so ill
and changed in so short a time that I was shocked, as well as
ashamed at the selfishness of having thought only of myself all the
morning.</p>
<p>But he would listen to no sympathy, protesting there was little
or nothing the matter with him, that "Conrad was croaking about
cancer," but the doctor was a fool.</p>
<p>"What about yourself, though?" he said. "Great doings at the
Castle, they're telling me."</p>
<p>I thought this a favourable opportunity to speak about my own
affairs, so I began on my story again, and though I found it harder
to tell now that my listener was my father, I struggled on and on,
as well as I could for the emotion that was choking me.</p>
<p>I thought he would pity me. I expected him to be angry. Although
he was showing me some of the contemptuous tenderness which he had
always assumed towards my mother, yet I was his daughter, and I
felt sure that he would want to leap out of bed that he might take
my husband by the throat and shake him as a terrier shakes a rat.
But what happened was something quite different.</p>
<p>Hardly had I begun when he burst out laughing.</p>
<p>"God bless my soul," he cried, "you're never going to lose your
stomach over a thing like that?"</p>
<p>I thought he had not understood me, so I tried to speak
plainer.</p>
<p>"I see," he said. "Sweethearting some other woman, is he? Well,
what of it? He isn't the first husband who has done the like, and I
guess he won't be the last."</p>
<p>Still I thought I had not made myself clear, so I said my
husband had been untrue to me, that his infidelities under my own
roof had degraded me in my own eyes and everybody else's, that I
could not bear to live such a life any longer and consequently. . .
.</p>
<p>"Consequently," said my father, "you come to me to fight your
battles for you. No, no, fight them yourself, gel. No father-in-law
ought to interfere."</p>
<p>It was a man's point of view I suppose, but I was ready to cry
with vexation and disappointment, and though I conquered the
impulse to do that I could go no farther.</p>
<p>"Who's the woman?" he asked.</p>
<p>I told him it was one of our house-party.</p>
<p>"Then cut her out. I guess you're clever enough to do it,
whoever she is. You've got the looks too, and I don't grudge you
the money. Cut her out&mdash;that's the best advice I can give you.
Make your husband see you're the better woman of the two. Cut her
out, I'm saying, and don't come whining here like a cry-baby, who
runs to her grandmother's apron-strings at the first scratch she
gets outside."</p>
<p>He had been reaching forward, but he now fell back on his
pillows, saying:</p>
<p>"I see how it is, though. Women without children are always
vapouring about their husbands, as if married life ought to be a
garden of Eden. One woman, one man, and all the rest of the
balderdash. I sot your Aunt Bridget on you before, gel, and I'll
have to do it again I'm thinking. But go away now. If I'm to get
better I must have rest. Nessy!" (calling) "I've a mort o' things
to do and most everything is on my shoulders. Nessy! My medicine!
Nessy! Nessy! Where in the world has that girl gone to?"</p>
<p>"I'm here, Daniel," said Nessy MacLeod coming back to the room;
and as I went out and passed down the corridor, with a crushed and
broken spirit and the tears ready to gush from my eyes, I heard her
coaxing him in her submissive and insincere tones, while he blamed
and scolded her.</p>
<p>Half an hour afterwards Aunt Bridget came to me in my mother's
room. Never in my life before had I been pleased to see her. She,
at least, would see my situation with a woman's eyes. But I was
doomed to another disappointment.</p>
<p>"Goodness me, girl," she cried, "what's this your father tells
me? One of your own guests, is it? That one with the big eyes I'll
go bail. Well, serve you right, I say, for bringing a woman like
that into the house with your husband&mdash;so smart and such a
quality toss with her. If you were lonely coming home why didn't
you ask your aunt or your first cousin? There would have been no
trouble with your husband then&mdash;not about me at all events.
But what are you thinking of doing?"</p>
<p>"Getting a divorce," I answered, firmly, for my heart was now
aflame.</p>
<p>If I had held a revolver in Aunt Bridget's face she could not
have looked more shocked.</p>
<p>"Mary O'Neill, are you mad?" she cried. "Divorce indeed! No
woman of our family has ever disgraced herself like that. What will
your father say? What's to happen to Betsy Beauty? What are people
going to think about me?"</p>
<p>I answered that I had not made my marriage, and those who had
made it must take the consequences.</p>
<p>"What does that matter now? Hundreds of thousands of women have
married the wrong man of their own free will, but if every woman
who has made a rue-bargain were to try to get out of it your way
where would the world be, I wonder? Perhaps you think you could
marry somebody else, but you couldn't. What decent man wants to
marry a divorced woman even if she <i>is</i> the injured
party?"</p>
<p>"Then you think I ought to submit&mdash;tamely submit to such
infidelities?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Sakes alive," said Aunt Bridget, "what else can you do? Men are
polygamous animals, and we women have to make up our minds to it.
Goodness knows I had to when the old colonel used to go hanging
around those English barmaids at the 'Cock and Hen.' Be a little
blind, girl&mdash;that's what nine wives out of ten have to be
every day and every night and all the world over."</p>
<p>"Will that make my husband any better?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I don't say it will," said Aunt Bridget. "It will make
<i>you</i> better, though. What the eye doesn't see the heart
doesn't grieve for. That's something, isn't it?"</p>
<p>When I went to bed that night my whole soul was in revolt. The
Church, the law, society, parental power, all the conventions and
respectabilities seemed to be in a conspiracy to condone my
husband's offence and to make me his scapegoat, doomed to a life of
hypocrisy and therefore immorality and shame. I would die rather
than endure it. Yes, I would die that very day rather than return
to my husband's house and go through the same ordeal again.</p>
<p>But next morning when I thought of Martin, as I always did on
first awakening, I told myself that I would live and be a clean
woman in my own eyes <i>whatever the World might think of
me</i>.</p>
<p>Martin was now my only refuge, so I would tell him everything.
It would be hard to do that, but no matter, I would crush down my
modesty and tell him everything. And then, whatever he told me to
do I should do it.</p>
<p>I knew quite well what my resolution meant, what it implied and
involved, but still I thought, "<i>Whatever he tells me to do I
will do it</i>."</p>
<p>I remembered what the Countess in Rome had said about a life of
"complete emancipation" as an escape from unhappy marriage, and
even yet I thought "<i>Whatever he tells me to do I will do
it</i>."</p>
<p>After coming to that conclusion I felt more at ease and got up
to dress.</p>
<p>It was a beautiful morning, and I looked down into the orchard,
where the apples were reddening under the sunshine and the
gooseberries were ripening under their hanging boughs, when in the
quiet summer air I heard a footstep approaching.</p>
<p>An elderly woman in an old-fashioned quakerish bonnet was coming
up the drive. She carried a little bunch of red and white roses,
and her face, which was very sweet and simple, wore the pathetic
expression of a child in trouble.</p>
<p>It was Martin's mother. She was coming to see me, and at the
first sight of her something told me that my brave resolution was
about to be broken, and I was going to be shaken to the depths of
my being.</p>
<p>I heard the bell of the front door ringing. After a moment a
maid came up and said:</p>
<p>"Mrs. Doctor Conrad has called to see your ladyship."</p>
<p>"Bring her here," I answered.</p>
<p>My heart was in my mouth already.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SIXTY_FIRST_CHAPTER" id=
"SIXTY_FIRST_CHAPTER"></a>SIXTY-FIRST CHAPTER</h2>
<p>When Martin's mother came into the room she looked nervous and
almost frightened, as if she had charged herself with a mission
which she was afraid to fulfil. But I put her to sit in my mother's
easy chair and sat on the arm of it myself, and then she seemed
calmer and more comfortable.</p>
<p>In spite of the silver threads in the smooth hair under her poke
bonnet her dear face was still the face of a child, and never
before had it seemed to me so helpless and child-like.</p>
<p>After a moment we began to talk of Martin. I said it must be a
great happiness to her to have him back after his long and perilous
voyage; and she answered that it was, but his visit was so short,
only four days altogether, although the doctor and she had looked
forward to it so long.</p>
<p>"That's not Martin's fault, though," she said. "He's such a good
son. I really, really think no mother ever had such a good son. But
when children grow up they can't always be thinking of the old
people, can they? That's why I say to the doctor, 'Doctor,' I say,
'perhaps we were the same ourselves when we were young and first
loved each other.'"</p>
<p>Already I thought I saw vaguely what the dear soul had come to
tell me, but I only said I supposed Martin was still with them.</p>
<p>She told me no, he had gone to King George's. That was his old
school, and being prize-giving day the masters had asked him to the
sports and to the dinner that was to be given that night before the
breaking-up for the holidays.</p>
<p>"The boys will give him a cheer, I know they will," she
said.</p>
<p>I said of course he would be back to-morrow, but again she said
no; he had gone for good, and they had said good-bye to him. When
he left King George's he was to go on to Castle Raa. Didn't I know
that? He had said he would telegraph to me. But being from home
perhaps I had not yet received his message. Oh yes, he was going on
to the Castle to-morrow night and would stay there until it was
time to leave the island.</p>
<p>"I'm so glad," I said, hardly knowing with what fervour I had
said it, until I saw the same expression of fear come back to the
sweet old face.</p>
<p>"Martin will be glad, too," she said, "and that's why
I've come to see you."</p>
<p>"That?"</p>
<p>"You won't be cross with me, will you? But Martin is so fond of
you. . . . He always has been fond of you, ever since he was a boy
. . . but this time. . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"This time I thought . . . I really, really thought he was too
fond of you."</p>
<p>I had to hold my breast to keep down the cry of joy that was
rising to my throat, but the dear soul saw nothing.</p>
<p>"Not that he said so&mdash;not to say said so, but it's a mother
to see things, isn't it? And he was talking and talking so much
about Mary O'Neill that I was frightened&mdash;really
frightened."</p>
<p>"Frightened?"</p>
<p>"He's so tender-hearted, you see. And then you . . . you're such
a wonderful woman grown. Tommy the Mate says there hasn't been the
like of you on this island since they laid your mother under the
sod. It's truth enough, too&mdash;gospel truth. And
Martin&mdash;Martin says there isn't your equal, no, not in London
itself neither. So . . . so," she said, trembling and stammering,
"I was thinking . . . I was thinking he was only flesh and blood
like the rest of us, poor boy, and if he got to be <i>too</i> fond
of you . . . now that you're married and have a husband, you know.
. . ."</p>
<p>The trembling and stammering stopped her for a moment.</p>
<p>"They're saying you are not very happy in your marriage neither.
Times and times I've heard people saying he isn't kind to you, and
they married you against your will. . . . So I was telling myself
if that's so, and Martin and you came together now, and you
encouraged him, and let him go on and anything came of it . . . any
trouble or disgrace or the like of that . . . it would be such a
terrible cruel shocking thing for the boy . . . just when
everybody's talking about him and speaking so well too."</p>
<p>It was out at last. Her poor broken-hearted story was told.
Being a married woman, unhappily married, too, I was a danger to
her beloved son, and she had come to me in her sweet, unmindful,
motherly selfishness to ask me to protect him <i>against
myself</i>.</p>
<p>"Whiles and whiles I've been thinking of it," she said. "'What
will I do?' I've been asking myself, and sometimes I've been
thinking I would speak to Martin. I didn't dare do it, though. But
when I heard last night that you had come home to see your father,
I said: 'Doctor, I'll go over and speak to herself.' 'You'll never
do that, Christian Ann,' said the doctor. 'Yes, I will,' I said.
'I'll speak to the young mistress herself. She may be a great lady
now, but haven't I nursed her on my knee? She'll never do anything
to harm my boy, if I ask her not to. No indeed she won't. Not Mary
O'Neill. I'll never believe it of her. Never in this world.'"</p>
<p>The sweet old face was beaming but it was wet with tears, too,
and while trying to get out her pocket-handkerchief, she was
fumbling with the flowers which she was still holding and passing
from hand to hand.</p>
<p>"Let me take the roses," I said as well as I could, for I could
scarcely say anything.</p>
<p>"I brought them for you," she said, and then she laughed, a
little confusedly, at her own forgetfulness.</p>
<p>"To be sure they're nothing to the green-house ones you'll have
at the Castle, but I thought you'd like them for all that. They're
from the tree outside the window of your own little room. We call
it your room still&mdash;the one you slept in when you came in your
little velvet frock and pinnie, singing carols to my door. 'Mary
O'Neill's room,' Martin called it then, and it's been the same to
us ever since."</p>
<p>This touched me so deeply that, before I knew what I was doing,
I was putting my arm about her waist and asking her to tell me what
she wished me to do and I would do it.</p>
<p>"Will you, though?" she said, and then one by one she propounded
the artless little schemes she had concocted to cure Martin of what
she conceived to be his love for me.</p>
<p>Her first thought was that I might make excuse of my father's
illness to remain where I was until the time came for Martin to
leave the island; but she repented of this almost immediately,
remembering that Martin was set on seeing me, ('I <i>must</i> see
her,' he had said) and if he did not see me he would be so
downhearted.</p>
<p>Then she thought I might praise up my husband to Martin, saying
what a fine man he was to be sure, and how good he had been to me,
and what a proud woman I was to be married to him; but she was
ashamed of that almost as soon as she had said it, for it might not
be true, and Martin might see I was pretending.</p>
<p>Finally, she suggested that in order to create a coolness
between Martin and myself I might try not to be so nice to him,
speaking short to him sometimes, and even harsh and angry; but no,
that would be too cruel, especially from me, after all these years,
just when he was going so far away, too, and only the Lord and the
blessed saints knew what was to become of him.</p>
<p>It was Martin, Martin, always Martin. Still in her sweet
motherly selfishness she could think of nobody else. Fondly as she
loved me, it never occurred to her for a moment that if I did what
she wished and sent Martin away from me, I too would suffer. But a
harder heart than mine would have melted at the sight of her
perplexity and distress, and when with a helpless look she
said:</p>
<p>"I don't know what you are to do&mdash;I really, really don't,"
I comforted her (needing comfort so much myself), and told her I
would find a way of my own to do what she desired.</p>
<p>"Will you, though?" she said.</p>
<p>"Indeed I will."</p>
<p>"And you won't send him away sore-hearted, either?"</p>
<p>"Indeed I won't."</p>
<p>"I knew you would say that. May the Lord and His holy Mother
bless you!"</p>
<p>She was weeping tender, copious, blessed tears by this time, but
there were smiles behind them.</p>
<p>"Not that there's another woman in the world I would rather give
him to if things were as they used to be. But they're different
now, are they not?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, they're different now," I answered.</p>
<p>"But are you sure you're not cross with me for coming?"</p>
<p>"Oh, no, no," I said, and it was all I <i>could</i> say for my
voice was failing me.</p>
<p>She gave a sigh of inexpressible relief and then rose to go.</p>
<p>"I must be going now. The doctor is digging in the garden and he
hasn't had his breakfast. But I put the pot on the <i>slouree</i>
to boil and it will be ready for the porridge."</p>
<p>She got as far as the door and then turned and said:</p>
<p>"I wish I had a photo of you&mdash;a right one, just as you are
at this very minute. I'd hang it in your own room, and times and
times in the day I'd be running upstairs to look at it. But it's
all as one. I've got a photo of you here," (touching her breast)
"and sometimes I can see it as plain as plain."</p>
<p>I could not speak after that, but I kissed her as she was going
out, and she said:</p>
<p>"That's nice, now! Good-bye, <i>my chree!</i> You'll not be
going home until to-morrow, it's like, so perhaps I'll be putting
another sight on you. Good-bye!"</p>
<p>I went to the window to watch her as she walked down the drive.
She was wiping her eyes, but her head was up and I thought her step
was light, and I was sure her face was shining.</p>
<p>God bless her! The dear sweet woman! Such women as she is, and
my mother was&mdash;so humble and loving, so guileless and pure,
never saying an unkind word or thinking an unkind thought&mdash;are
the flowers of the world that make the earth smell sweet.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>When she was gone and I remembered the promise I had made to her
I asked myself what was to become of me. If I could neither divorce
my husband under any circumstances without breaking a sacrament of
the Church, nor love Martin and be loved by him without breaking
the heart of his mother, where was I?</p>
<p>I intended to go home the following morning; I was to meet
Martin the following night. What was I to say? What was I to
do?</p>
<p>All day long these questions haunted me and I could find no
answers. But towards evening I took my troubles where I had often
taken them&mdash;to Father Dan.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SIXTY_SECOND_CHAPTER" id=
"SIXTY_SECOND_CHAPTER"></a>SIXTY-SECOND CHAPTER</h2>
<p>The door of the Presbytery was opened by Father Dan's Irish
housekeeper, a good old soul whose attitude to her master was that
of a "moithered" mother to a wilful child.</p>
<p>All the way up the narrow staircase to his room, she grumbled
about his reverence. Unless he was sickening for the scarlet fever
she didn't know in her seven sinses what was a-matter with him
these days. He was as white as a ghost, and as thin as a shadder,
and no wonder neither, for he didn't eat enough to keep body and
soul together.</p>
<p>Yesterday itself she had cooked him a chicken as good as I could
get at the Big House; "done to a turn, too, with a nice bit of
Irish bacon on top, and a bowl of praties biled in their jackets
and a basin of beautiful new buttermilk;" but no, never a taste nor
a sup did he take of it.</p>
<p>"It's just timpting Providence his reverence is, and it'll be
glory to God if you'll tell him so."</p>
<p>"What's that you're saying about his reverence, Mrs. Cassidy?"
cried Father Dan from the upper landing.</p>
<p>"I'm saying you're destroying yourself with your fasting and
praying and your midnight calls at mountain cabins, and never a
ha'porth of anything in your stomach to do it on."</p>
<p>"Whisht then, Mrs. Cassidy, it's tay-time, isn't it? So just
step back to your kitchen and put on your kittle, and bring up two
of your best china cups and saucers, and a nice piece of buttered
toast, not forgetting a thimbleful of something neat, and then it's
the mighty proud woman ye'll be entoirely to be waiting for once on
the first lady in the island. . . . Come in, my daughter, come
in."</p>
<p>He was laughing as he let loose his Irish tongue, but I could
see that his housekeeper had not been wrong and that he looked worn
and troubled.</p>
<p>As soon as he had taken me into his cosy study and put me to sit
in the big chair before the peat and wood fire, I would have begun
on my errand, but not a word would he hear until the tea had come
up and I had taken a cup of it.</p>
<p>Then stirring the peats for light as well as warmth, (for the
room was dark with its lining of books, and the evening was closing
in) he said:</p>
<p>"Now what is it? Something serious&mdash;I can see that
much."</p>
<p>"It <i>is</i> serious, Father Dan."</p>
<p>"Tell me then," he said, and as well as I could I told him my
story.</p>
<p>I told him that since I had seen him last, during that violent
scene at Castle Raa, my relations with my husband had become still
more painful; I told him that, seeing I could not endure any longer
the degradation of the life I was living, I had thought about
divorce; I told him that going first to the Bishop and afterwards
to my father's advocate I had learned that neither the Church nor
the law, for their different reasons, could grant me the relief I
required; and finally, in a faint voice (almost afraid to hear
myself speak it), I told him my solemn and sacred secret&mdash;that
whatever happened I could not continue to live where I was now
living because I loved somebody else than my husband.</p>
<p>While I was speaking Father Dan was shuffling his feet and
plucking at his shabby cassock, and as soon as I had finished he
flashed out on me with an anger I had never seen in his face or
heard in his voice before.</p>
<p>"I know who it is," he said. "It's Martin Conrad."</p>
<p>I was so startled by this that I was beginning to ask how he
knew, when he cried:</p>
<p>"Never mind how I know. Perhaps you think an old priest has no
eyes for anything but his breviary, eh? It's young Martin, isn't
it?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"The wretch, the rascal, the scoundrel! If he ever dares to come
to this house again, I'll slam the door in his face."</p>
<p>I knew he loved Martin almost as much as I did, so I paid no
heed to the names he was calling him, but I tried to say that I
alone had been to blame, and that Martin had done nothing.</p>
<p>"Don't tell me he has done nothing," cried Father Dan. "I know
what he has done He has told you he loves you, hasn't he?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"He has been colloguing with you, then, and getting you to say
things?"</p>
<p>"Never."</p>
<p>"Pitying and sympathising with you, anyway, in your relations
with your husband?"</p>
<p>"Not for one moment."</p>
<p>"He had better not! Big man as he is in England now, I'll warm
his jacket for him if he comes here making mischief with a child of
mine. But thank the Lord and the holy saints he's going away soon,
so you'll see no more of him."</p>
<p>"But he is coming to Castle Raa," I said, "and I am to see him
to-morrow night."</p>
<p>"That too! The young scoundrel!"</p>
<p>I explained that my husband had invited him, being prompted to
do so by the other woman.</p>
<p>"Worse and worse!" cried Father Dan. "Don't you see that they're
laying a trap for you, and like two young fools you're walking
directly into it. But no matter! You mustn't go."</p>
<p>I told him that I should be compelled to do so, for Martin was
coming on my account only, and I could neither tell him the truth
nor make an excuse that would not be a falsehood.</p>
<p>"Well, well, perhaps you're right there. It's not the best way
to meet temptation to be always running away from it. That's Irish,
but it's true enough, though. You must conquer this temptation, my
child; you must fight it and overcome it."</p>
<p>"But I've tried and tried and I cannot," I said.</p>
<p>And then I told him the story of my struggle&mdash;how love had
been no happiness to me but only a cruel warfare, how I had
suffered and prayed and gone to mass and confession, yet all to no
purpose, for my affection for Martin was like a blazing fire which
nothing could put out.</p>
<p>Father Dan's hands and lips were trembling while I spoke and I
could see that he was shuddering with pity for me, so I went on to
say that if God had put this pure and holy love into my heart could
it be wrong&mdash;</p>
<p>"Stop a minute," cried Father Dan. "Who says God put it there?
And who informed you it was pure and holy? Let us see where we are.
Come, now. You say the Bishop told you that you could never be
divorced under any circumstances?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Yet you wish to leave your husband?"</p>
<p>"How can I help it? The life I have been living is too
horrible."</p>
<p>"Never mind that now. You wish to leave your husband, don't
you?"</p>
<p>"I . . . I must."</p>
<p>"And you want to go to this . . . this young . . . in short, you
want to go to Martin Conrad? That's the plain truth, isn't it?
Don't deny it. Very well, let us call things by their proper names.
What is the fact? You are asking me&mdash;me, your spiritual
Father&mdash;to allow you to live a life of open adultery. That's
what it comes to. You know it is, and God and His holy Mother have
mercy on your soul!"</p>
<p>I was so startled and shocked by his fierce assault, and by the
cruel climax it had come to, that I flung up my hands to my face
and kept them there, for I felt as if my brain had been stunned and
my heart was bursting.</p>
<p>How long I sat like this, with my hidden face to the fire, I do
not know; but after a long silence in which I heard nothing but my
own heaving breath, I became aware that Father Dan had drawn one of
my hands down to his knee and was smoothing it with his own.</p>
<p>"Don't be angry with your old priest for telling you the truth,"
he said. "It's hard to bear; I know it's hard; but it's as hard for
him as for you, my child. Think&mdash;only think what he is trying
to save you from. If you do what you wish to do, you will put
yourself out of communion. If you put yourself out of communion,
you will cease to be a Catholic. What will become of you then, my
daughter? What will be left to replace the consolations of the
Church&mdash;in sorrow, in suffering, in the hour of death? Have
you never thought of that?"</p>
<p>I never had. It was thrilling through and through me.</p>
<p>"You say you cannot live any longer with your husband because he
has broken the vow he made to you at your marriage. But think how
many many thousands of poor women all the world over are doing it
every day&mdash;living with adulterous husbands for the sake of
their homes and children. And not for the sake of their homes and
children only, but for the sake of their souls and their religion.
Blessed, blessed martyrs, though we know nothing about them,
holding society and the Church and the human family together."</p>
<p>I was trembling all over. I felt as if Father Dan were trying to
take away from me the only sweet and precious thing in my life that
was left.</p>
<p>"Then you think you cannot live without the one you love,
because all your heart is full of him. But think of the holy women,
the holy saints, who have gone through the same
temptation&mdash;fighting against it with all the strength of their
souls until the very wounds of our blessed Lord have been marked on
their bodies."</p>
<p>He was creeping closer to my side. His voice was quivering at my
ear. I was struggling hard, and still trembling all over.</p>
<p>"Hold fast by the Church, my child. It is your only refuge.
Remember that God made your marriage and you cannot break it
without forsaking your faith. Can anything be good that is bought
at such a price? Nothing in this world! When you meet to-morrow
night&mdash;you two children&mdash;tell him that. Tell him I told
you to say so. . . . I love you both. Don't break your old priest's
heart. He's in trouble enough for you already. Don't let him think
that he must lose you altogether. And then remember your mother,
too&mdash;that saint in heaven who suffered so long and was
patient. . . . Everything will depend upon you, my child. In
matters of this kind the woman is the stronger vessel. Be strong
for him also. Renounce your guilty love, my daughter&mdash;"</p>
<p>"But I cannot, I cannot," I said. "I love him, and I cannot give
him up!"</p>
<p>"Let us ask God to help you," said Father Dan, and still holding
my hand he drew me down to my knees and knelt beside me. The room
was dark by this time, and only the sullen glow from the peat fire
was on our faces.</p>
<p>Then in a low voice, so low that it was like his throbbing
whisper before the altar, when he raised the Sacred host, Father
Dan prayed for me (calling me his dear child whom God had committed
to his care) that I might keep my marriage vow and be saved from
the temptation to break it.</p>
<p>His beautiful prayer or his throbbing voice, or both together,
had a great effect upon me, and when I rose to my feet, I felt
stronger. Although Martin was as dear to me as ever, I thought I
saw my way at last. If he loved me as I loved him, I had to be
brave for both of us. I had to oppose to the carnal instinct of
love the spiritual impulse of renunciation. Yes, yes, that was what
I had to do.</p>
<p>Father Dan saw me to the door.</p>
<p>"Give my love to my boy," he said, "and don't forget what I told
you to tell him."</p>
<p>"I'll tell him," I replied, for though I knew my heart was
bleeding I felt calm and more courageous.</p>
<p>It was milking time and the cows were lowing in the byre when I
crossed the fields and the farm-yard on my way back to my father's
house.</p>
<p>Early next morning I left it for Castle Raa.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SIXTY_THIRD_CHAPTER" id=
"SIXTY_THIRD_CHAPTER"></a>SIXTY-THIRD CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Although it was mid-day before I reached the Castle, the gate to
the park had not been opened, the drive was deserted and even the
great door to the house itself was closed.</p>
<p>And when, in answer to my ringing, one of the maids came after a
certain delay, wearing neither apron nor cap, I found the hall
empty and no sign of life in the house, except a shrill chorus of
laughter which came from the servants' quarters.</p>
<p>"What's the meaning of this?" I asked, but before the girl could
reply, Price who had come down to take my wraps said:</p>
<p>"I'll tell your ladyship presently."</p>
<p>As we were going upstairs she told me that the entire
house-party had that morning gone off on a cruise in Mr.
Eastcliff's yacht, that they would be away several days, and that
Madame had left a letter for me which was supposed to explain
everything.</p>
<p>I found it on the mantelpiece in my boudoir under an open
telegram which had been stuck into the edge of the bevelled glass.
The telegram, which was addressed to me, was from Martin.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>"Expect to arrive to-morrow evening. Staying until Wednesday
afternoon. If not convenient wire Principal's House, King George's
College."</i></p>
</div>
<p>"To-morrow'?"</p>
<p>"That means to-day," said Price. "The telegram came yesterday.
Madame opened it and she told me to say&mdash;"</p>
<p>"Let me read her letter first," I said.</p>
<p>The letter ran as follows:</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>"My Dearest Mary</i>,</p>
<p>"<i>You will be astonished to find the house empty and all your
racketty guests gone. Let me explain, and if you are angry about
what has happened you must lay all the blame on me</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Well, you see, my dear, it was arranged nearly a month ago
that before we left your delightful house we should make a little
cruise round your charming island. But we had not expected that
this would come off so soon, when suddenly and unexpectedly that
silly Mr. Eastcliff, who has no more brains than a spring chicken,
remembered that he had promised to visit a friend who has taken a
shoot in Skye. Result&mdash;we had to make the cruise immediately
or not at all, and yet behold! our hostess was away on an urgent
call of sickness, and what in the world were we to do without
her</i>?</p>
<p>"<i>Everybody was in a quandary&mdash;that wise Mr. Vivian
saying it would be 'jolly bad form by Jove' to go without you,
while Mr. Eastcliffs 'deelightfully vicked' little Camilla declared
it would be 'vilaynous,' and your husband vowed that his Margaret
Mary could not possibly be left behind</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>It was then that a certain friend of yours took the liberty
of remembering that you did not like the sea, and that even if you
had been here and had consented to go with us it would have been
only out of the sweetness of your heart, which I've always known to
be the tenderest and most unselfish in the world</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>This seemed to satisfy the whole house and everybody was at
ease, when lo! down on us like a thunderbolt came the telegram from
Mr. Conrad. Thinking it might require to be repeated, I took the
liberty of opening it, and then we were in a plight, I assure
you</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>What on earth was he to think of our leaving the house when
he was on the point of arriving? And, above all, how were we to
support the disappointment of missing him&mdash;some of us, the
women especially, and myself in particular, being just crazy to see
him again</i>?</p>
<p>"<i>This nearly broke down our plans altogether, but once more I
came to the rescue by remembering that Mr. Conrad was not coming to
see us but you, and that the very kindest thing we could do for a
serious person of his kind would be to take our racketty presence
out of the way</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>That contented everybody except my mother, who&mdash;would
you believe it?&mdash;had gotten some prudish notions into her head
about the impropriety of leaving you alone, and declared her
intention of staying behind to keep you in countenance! We soon
laughed her out of that, though, and now, to relieve you of her
company, we are carrying her away with us&mdash;which will be lots
of fun, for she's as fond of water as a cat and will fancy she is
seasick all the time</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Good-bye, dearest! We're just off. I envy you. You happy,
happy girl! I am sure you will have such a good time. What a man!
As natural as nature! I see, by the insular paper that your
islanders adore him</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Hope you found your father better. Another wonderful man!
Such an original type, too! Good-bye, my dearest dear</i>,
ALMA.</p>
<p>"<i>P.S. Have missed you so much, darling! Castle Raa wasn't the
same place without you&mdash;I assure you it wasn't</i>."</p>
</div>
<p>While I was turning this letter over in my hand, wondering what
the beautiful fiend had meant by it, my maid, who was standing by,
was visibly burning with a desire to know its contents and give me
the benefit of her own interpretation.</p>
<p>I told her in general what Alma had said and she burst into
little screams of indignation.</p>
<p>"Well, the huzzy! The wicked huzzy! That's all she is, my lady,
begging your pardon, and there's no other name for her. Arranged a
month ago, indeed! It was never thought of until last night after
Mr. Conrad's telegram came."</p>
<p>"Then what does it mean?"</p>
<p>"I can tell your ladyship what it means, if you'll promise not
to fly out at me again. It means that Madame wants to stand in your
shoes, and wouldn't mind going through the divorce court to do so.
And seeing that you can't be tempted to divorce your husband
because you are a Catholic, she thinks your husband, who isn't,
might be tempted to divorce you. So she's setting a trap for you,
and she expects you to fall into it while she's away, and if you
do. . . ."</p>
<p>"Impossible!"</p>
<p>"Oh, trust <i>me</i>, your ladyship. I haven't been keeping my
ears closed while your ladyship has been away, and if that
chatterbox of a maid of hers hadn't been such a fool I suppose she
would have been left behind to watch. But there's somebody else in
the house who thinks she has a grievance against you, and if
listening at keyholes will do anything . . . Hush!"</p>
<p>Price stopped suddenly with her finger to her lip, and then
going on tiptoe to the door she opened it with a jerk, when the
little housekeeper was to be seen rising to an upright position
while pretending that she had slipped.</p>
<p>"I only came to ask if her ladyship had lunched?" she said.</p>
<p>I answered that I had not, and then told her (so as to give her
no further excuse for hanging about me) that in future she was to
take her orders from Price&mdash;an announcement which caused my
maid to stand several inches taller in her shoes, and sent the
housekeeper hopping downstairs with her beak in the air like an
injured cockatoo.</p>
<p>All the afternoon I was in a state of the utmost agitation,
sometimes wondering what Martin would think of the bad manners of
my husband, who after inviting him had gone away just as he was
about to arrive; sometimes asking myself, with a quiver of shame,
if he would imagine that this was a scheme of my own contriving;
but oftenest remembering my resolution of renunciation and thinking
of the much fiercer fight that was before me now that I had to
receive and part with him alone.</p>
<p>More than once I had half a mind to telegraph to Martin putting
him off, and though I told myself that to do so would not be
renunciation but merely flight from temptation, I always knew at
the bottom of my heart that I really wanted him to come.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I vowed to my very soul that I should be
strong&mdash;strong in every word and look&mdash;and if Alma was
daring me I should defy her, and she would see that I should
neither yield nor run away.</p>
<p>Thus I entrenched myself at last in a sort of bright strong
faith in my power to resist temptation. But I must leave it to
those who know better than I the way to read a woman's heart to say
how it came to pass that towards five o'clock, when I heard the
sound of wheels and going on to my balcony saw a jaunting-car at
the front entrance, and then opening my door heard Martin's great
voice in the hall, I flew downstairs&mdash;literally flew&mdash;in
my eagerness to welcome him.</p>
<p>There he was in his brown Harris tweeds and soft slouch hat with
such an atmosphere of health and sweep of winds about him as almost
took away my breath.</p>
<p>"Helloa!" he cried, and I am sure his eyes brightened at the
sight of me for they were like the sea when the sun shines on
it.</p>
<p>"You're better, aren't you?" he said. "No need to ask that,
though&mdash;the colour in your face is wonderful."</p>
<p>In spite of my resolution, and the attempt I made to show him
only a kind of glad seriousness, I could not help it if I blushed.
Also I could not help it if, while going upstairs and telling him
what had happened to the house-party, I said he was doomed to the
disappointment of having nobody except myself for company, and
then, woman-like, waited eagerly for what he would say.</p>
<p>"So they're all gone except yourself, are they?" he said.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid they are," I answered.</p>
<p>"Well, if it had been the other way about, and you had gone and
they had stayed, by the stars of God, I <i>should</i> have been
disappointed. But things being as they are, we'll muddle through,
shan't we?"</p>
<p>Not all the vows in the world could prevent me from finding that
answer delightful, and when, on entering my boudoir, he said:</p>
<p>"Sorry to miss Madame though. I wanted a word with that lady
before I went down to the Antarctic," I could not resist the
mischievous impulse to show him Alma's letter.</p>
<p>While he read it his bright face darkened (for all the world
like a jeweller's window when the shutter comes down on it), and
when he had finished it he said once more:</p>
<p>"I hate that woman! She's like a snake. I'd like to put my foot
on it."</p>
<p>And then&mdash;</p>
<p>"She may run away as much as she likes, but I <i>will</i> yet,
you go bail, I will."</p>
<p>He was covered with dust and wanted to wash, so I rang for a
maid, who told me that Mr. and Mrs. Eastcliff's rooms had been
prepared for Mr. Conrad. This announcement (though I tried to seem
unmoved) overwhelmed me with confusion, seeing that the rooms in
question almost communicated with my own. But Martin only laughed
and said:</p>
<p>"Stunning! We'll live in this wing of the house and leave the
rest of the old barracks to the cats, should we?"</p>
<p>I was tingling with joy, but all the same I knew that a grim
battle was before me.</p>

"SIXTY_FOURTH_CHAPTER"></a>SIXTY-FOURTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>By the time he returned from his room I had tea served in my
boudoir, and while we sat facing the open door to the balcony he
told me about his visit to his old school; how at the dinner on the
previous night the Principal had proposed his health, and after the
lads had sung "Forty Years On" he had told them yarns about his
late expedition until they made the long hiss of indrawn breath
which is peculiar to boys when they are excited; how they had
followed him to his bedroom as if he had been the Pied Piper of
Hamelin and questioned him and clambered over him until driven off
by the house-master; and how, finally, before he was out of bed
this morning the smallest scholar in the junior house, a tiny
little cherub with the face of his mother, had come knocking at his
door to ask if he wanted a cabin boy.</p>
<p>Martin laughed as if he had been a boy himself (which he always
was and always will be) while telling me these stories, and I
laughed too, though with a certain tremor, for I was constantly
remembering my resolution and feeling afraid to be too happy.</p>
<p>After tea we went out on to the balcony, and leaned side by side
over the crumbling stone balustrade to look at the lovely
landscape&mdash;loveliest when the sun is setting on it&mdash;with
the flower-garden below and the headland beyond, covered with
heather and gorse and with a winding white path lying over it like
the lash of a whip until it dipped down to the sea.</p>
<p>"It's a beautiful old world, though, isn't it?" said Martin.</p>
<p>"Isn't it?" I answered, and we looked into each other's eyes and
smiled.</p>
<p>Then we heard the light <i>shsh</i> of a garden hose, and
looking down saw an old man watering the geraniums.</p>
<p>"Sakes alive! It's Tommy the Mate," cried Martin, and leaving me
on the balcony he went leaping down the stone stairway to greet his
old comrade.</p>
<p>"God bless me!" said Tommy. "Let me have a right look at ye.
Yes, yes, it's himself, for sure."</p>
<p>A little gale of tender memories floated up to me from my
childhood at seeing those two together again, with Martin now
standing head and shoulders above the old man's Glengarry cap.</p>
<p>"You've been over the highways of the sea, farther than Franklin
himself, they're telling me," said Tommy, and when Martin, laughing
merrily, admitted that he had been farther south at all events, the
old sailor said:</p>
<p>"Well, well! Think of that now! But wasn't I always telling the
omadhauns what you'd be doing some day?"</p>
<p>Then with a "glime" of his "starboard eye" in my direction he
said:</p>
<p>"You haven't got a woman yet though? . . . No, I thought not.
You're like myself, boy&mdash;there's not many of them sorts
<i>in</i> for you."</p>
<p>After that, and a more undisguised look my way, the old man
talked about me, still calling me the "lil misthress" and saying
they were putting a power of gold on my fingers, but he would be
burning candles to the miracles of God to see the colour of it in
my cheeks too.</p>
<p>"She's a plant that doesn't take kindly to a hot-house same as
this," (indicating the house) "and she'll not be thriving until
somebody's bedding her out, I'm thinking."</p>
<p>It was Saturday, and after dinner Martin proposed that we should
walk to the head of the cliff to see Blackwater by night, which was
a wonderful spectacle, people said, at the height of the season, so
I put a silk wrap over my head and we set out together.</p>
<p>There was no moon and few stars were visible, but it was one of
those luminous nights in summer which never forget the day.
Therefore we walked without difficulty along the white winding path
with its nutty odour of the heather and gorse until we came near
the edge of the cliff, and then suddenly the town burst upon our
view, with its promenades, theatres, and dancing palaces ablaze
with electric light, which was reflected with almost equal
brilliance in the smooth water of the bay.</p>
<p>We were five miles from Blackwater, but listening hard we
thought we could hear, through the boom of the sea on the dark
cliffs below us, the thin sounds of the bands that were playing in
the open-air pavilions, and looking steadfastly we thought we could
see, in the black patches under the white light, the movement of
the thousands of persons who were promenading along "the
front."</p>
<p>This led Martin to talk of my father, saying as we walked back,
with the dark outlines of the sleeping mountains confronting us,
what a marvellous man he had been to transform in twenty years the
little fishing and trading port into a great resort for hundreds of
thousands of pleasure-seekers.</p>
<p>"But is he any better or happier for the wealth it has brought
him, and for the connections he has bought with it? Is anybody any
better?" said Martin.</p>
<p>"I know one who isn't," I answered.</p>
<p>I had not meant to say that. It had slipped out unawares, and in
my confusion at the self-revelation which it seemed to make, I
tripped in the darkness and would have fallen if Martin had not
caught me up.</p>
<p>In doing this he had to put his arms about me and to hold me
until I was steady on my feet, and having done so he took my hand
and drew it through his arm and in this way we walked the rest of
the way back.</p>
<p>It would be impossible and perhaps foolish to say what that
incident meant to me. I felt a thrill of joy, a quivering flood of
delight which, with all the raptures of my spiritual love, had
never come to me before.</p>
<p>Every woman who loves her husband must know what it is, but to
me it was a great revelation. It was just as if some new passion
had sprung into life in me at a single moment. And it had&mdash;the
mighty passion that lies at the root of our being, the overwhelming
instinct of sex which, taking no account of religion and
resolutions, sweeps everything before it like a flood.</p>
<p>I think Martin must have felt it too, for all at once he ceased
to speak, and I was trembling so much with this new feeling of
tenderness that I could not utter a word. So I heard nothing as we
walked on but the crackle of our footsteps on the gravel path and
the measured boom of the sea which we were leaving behind
us&mdash;nothing but that and the quick beating in my own
breast.</p>
<p>When we came to the garden the frowning face of the old house
was in front of us, and it was all in darkness, save for the light
in my room which came out on to the balcony. Everything was quiet.
The air was breathless. There was not a rustle in the trees.</p>
<p>We took two or three turns on the lawn in front of my windows,
saying nothing but feeling terribly, fearfully happy. After a few
moments (or they seemed few) a cuckoo clock on my desk struck
eleven, and we went up the stone stairway into my boudoir and
parted for the night.</p>
<p>Even then we did not speak, but Martin took my hand and lifted
my fingers to his lips, and the quivering delight I had been
feeling ever since I slipped on the headland rushed through me
again.</p>
<p>At the next moment I was in my room. I did not turn on the
light. I undressed in the darkness and when my maid came I was in
bed. She wanted to tell me about a scene with the housekeeper in
the kitchen, but I said:</p>
<p>"I don't want to talk to-night, Price."</p>
<p>I did not know what was happening to me. I only knew, for the
first time that night, that above everything else I was a woman,
and that my renunciation, if it was ever to come to pass, would be
a still more tragic thing than I had expected.</p>
<p>My grim battle had begun.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SIXTY_FIFTH_CHAPTER" id=
"SIXTY_FIFTH_CHAPTER"></a>SIXTY-FIFTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>When I awoke in the morning I took myself severely to task. Was
this how I was fulfilling the promise I had made to Martin's
mother, or preparing to carry out the counsel of Father Dan?</p>
<p>"I must be more careful," I told myself. "I must keep a stronger
hold of myself."</p>
<p>The church bells began to ring, and I determined to go to mass.
I wanted to go alone and much as I grudged every minute of Martin's
company which I lost, I was almost glad when, on going into the
boudoir with my missal in my hand, I found him at a table covered
with papers and heard him say:</p>
<p>"Helloa! See these letters and telegrams? Sunday as it is I've
got to answer them."</p>
<p>Our church was a little chapel-of-ease on the edge of my
husband's estate, opened, after centuries of neglect, by the bad
Lord Raa, in his regenerate days, for the benefit of the people of
his own village. It was very sweet to see their homely faces as
they reverently bowed and rose, and even to hear their creachy
voices when they joined in the singing of the Gloria.</p>
<p>Following the gospel there was a sermon on the words "Lead us
not into temptation but deliver us from evil." The preacher was a
young curate, the brother of my husband's coachman; and it occurred
to me that he could know very little of temptation for himself, but
the instruction he gave us was according to the doctrine of our
Church, as I had received it from the Reverend Mother and the
Cardinals who used to hold retreats at the convent.</p>
<p>"Beware of the temptations of the flesh, my children," said the
priest. "The Evil One is very subtle, and not only in our moments
of pride and prosperity, but also in our hours of sorrow and
affliction, he is for ever waiting and watching to betray us to our
downfall and damnation."</p>
<p>In the rustling that followed the sermon a poor woman who sat
next to me, with a print handkerchief over her head, whispered in
my ear that she was sorry she had not brought her husband, for he
had given way to drink, poor fellow, since the island had had such
good times and wages had been so high.</p>
<p>But the message came closer home to me. Remembering the emotions
of the night before, I prayed fervently to be strengthened against
all temptation and preserved from all sin. And when the mass was
resumed I recalled some of the good words with which I had been
taught to assist at the Holy Sacrifice&mdash;praying at the
<i>Credo</i> that as I had become a child in the bosom of the
Church I might live and die in it.</p>
<p>When the service was over I felt more at ease and I emptied my
purse, I remember, partly into the plate and partly to the poor
people at the church door.</p>
<p>It was in this spirit that I returned home in the broad sunshine
of noonday. But half way up the drive I met Martin walking briskly
down to meet me. He was bareheaded and in flannels; and I could not
help it if he looked to me so good, so strong, and so well able to
protect a woman against every danger, that the instructions I had
received in church, and the resolutions I had formed there, seemed
to run out of my heart as rapidly as the dry sand of the sea-shore
runs through one's fingers.</p>
<p>"Helloa!" he cried, as usual. "The way I've been wasting this
wonderful morning over letters and telegrams! But not another
minute will I give to anything under the stars of God but you."</p>
<p>If there was any woman in the world who could have resisted that
greeting I was not she, and though I was a little confused I was
very happy.</p>
<p>As we walked back to the house we talked of my father and his
sudden illness, then of his mother and my glimpse of her, and
finally of indifferent things, such as the weather, which had been
a long drought and might end in a deluge.</p>
<p>By a sort of mutual consent we never once spoke of the central
subject of our thoughts&mdash;my marriage and its fatal
consequences&mdash;but I noticed that Martin's voice was soft and
caressing, that he was walking close to my side, and that as often
as I looked up at him he was looking down at me and smiling.</p>
<p>It was the same after luncheon when we went out into the garden
and sat on a seat in the shrubbery almost immediately facing my
windows, and he spread a chart on a rustic table and pointing to a
red line on it said:</p>
<p>"Look, this is the course of our new cruise, please God."</p>
<p>He talked for a long time, about his captain and crew; the
scientific experts who had volunteered to accompany him, his
aeronautic outfit, his sledges and his skis; but whatever he talked
about&mdash;if it was only his dogs and the food he had found for
them&mdash;it was always in that soft, caressing voice which made
me feel as if (though he never said one word of love) he were
making love to me, and saying the sweetest things a man could say
to a woman.</p>
<p>After a time I found myself answering in the same tones, and
even when speaking on the most matter-of-fact subjects I felt as if
I were saying the sweetest things a woman could say to a man.</p>
<p>We sat a long time so, and every moment we were together seemed
to make our relation more perilous, until at length the sweet
seductive twilight of the shortening autumn day began to frighten
me, and making excuse of a headache I said I must go indoors.</p>
<p>He walked with me up the stone-stairway and into my boudoir,
until we got to the very door of my room, and then suddenly he took
up both my hands and kissed them passionately.</p>
<p>I felt the colour rushing to my cheeks and I had an almost
irresistible impulse to do something in return. But conquering it
with a great effort, I turned quickly into my bedroom, shut the
door, pulled down the blinds and then sat and covered my face and
asked myself, with many bitter pangs, if it could possibly be true
(as I had been taught to believe) that our nature was evil and our
senses were always tempting us to our destruction.</p>
<p>Several hours passed while I sat in the darkness with this
warfare going on between my love and my religion, and then Price
came to dress me for dinner, and she was full of cheerful
gossip.</p>
<p>"Men are <i>such</i> children," she said; "they can't help
giving themselves away, can they?"</p>
<p>It turned out that after I had left the lawn she had had some
conversation with Martin, and I could see that she was eager to
tell me what he had said about myself.</p>
<p>"The talk began about your health and altered looks, my lady.
'Don't you think your mistress is looking ill?' said he. 'A
little,' I said. 'But her body is not so ill as her heart, if you
ask me,' said I."</p>
<p>"You never said that, Price?"</p>
<p>"Well, I could not help saying it if I thought so, could I?"</p>
<p>"And what did he say?"</p>
<p>"He didn't say anything then, my lady, but when I said, 'You
see, sir, my lady is tied to a husband she doesn't love,' he said,
'How can she, poor thing? 'Worse than that,' I said, 'her husband
loves another woman.' 'The fool! Where does he keep his eyes?' said
he. 'Worse still,' said I, 'he flaunts his infidelities in her very
face.' 'The brute!' he said, and his face looked so fierce that you
would have thought he wanted to take his lordship by the throat and
choke him. 'Why doesn't she leave the man?' said he. 'That's what I
say, sir, but I think it's her religion,' I said. 'Then God help
her, for there's no remedy for that,' said he. And then seeing him
so down I said, 'But we women are always ruled by our hearts in the
long run.' 'Do you think so?' said he. 'I'm sure of it,' said I,
'only we must have somebody to help us,' I said. 'There's her
father,' said he. 'A father is of no use in a case like this,' I
said, 'especially such a one as my lady's is, according to all
reports. No,' said I, 'it must be somebody else&mdash;somebody who
cares enough for a woman to risk everything for her, and just take
her and make her do what's best for herself whether she likes it or
not. Now if somebody like that were to come to my lady, and get her
out of her trouble,' I said. . . . 'Somebody will,' said he. 'Make
your mind easy about that. Somebody will,' he said, and then he
went on walking to and fro."</p>
<p>Price told this story as if she thought she was bringing me the
gladdest of glad tidings; but the idea that Martin had come back
into my life to master me, to take possession of me, to claim me as
his own (just as he did when I was a child) and thereby compel me
to do what I had promised his mother and Father Dan not to
do&mdash;this was terrifying.</p>
<p>But there was a secret joy in it too, and every woman will know
what I mean if I say that my heart was beating high with the fierce
delight of belonging to somebody when I returned to the boudoir
where Martin was waiting to sit down to dinner.</p>
<p>Then came a great surprise.</p>
<p>Martin was standing with his back to the fire-place, and I saw
in a moment that the few hours which had intervened had changed him
as much as they had changed me.</p>
<p>"Helloa! Better, aren't we?" he cried, but he was now cold,
almost distant, and even his hearty voice seemed to have sunk to a
kind of nervous treble.</p>
<p>I could not at first understand this, but after a while I began
to see that we two had reached the point beyond which it was
impossible to go without encountering the most tremendous fact of
our lives&mdash;my marriage and all that was involved by it.</p>
<p>During dinner we spoke very little. He seemed intentionally not
to look at me. The warm glances of his sea-blue eyes, which all the
afternoon had been making the colour mount to my cheeks, had gone,
and it sent a cold chill to my heart to look across the table at
his clouded face. But sometimes when he thought my own face was
down I was conscious that his eyes were fixed on me with a
questioning, almost an imploring gaze. His nervousness communicated
itself to me. It was almost as if we had begun to be afraid of each
other and were hovering on the brink of fatal revelations.</p>
<p>When dinner was over, the table cleared and the servants gone, I
could bear the strain no longer, so making excuse of a letter I had
to write to the Reverend Mother I sat down at my desk, whereupon
Martin lit a cigar and said he would stroll over the headland.</p>
<p>I heard his footsteps going down the stone stairway from the
balcony; I heard their soft thud on the grass of the lawn; I heard
their sharper crackle on the gravel of the white path, and then
they mingled with the surge and wash of the flowing tide and died
away in the distance.</p>
<p>I rose from the desk, and going over to the balcony door looked
out into the darkness. It was a beautiful, pathetic, heart-breaking
night. No moon, but a perfect canopy of stars in a deep blue sky.
The fragrance of unseen flowers&mdash;sweetbriar and rose as well
as ripening fruit&mdash;came up from the garden. There was no wind
either, not even the rustle of a leaf, and the last bird of evening
was silent. All the great orchestra of nature was still, save for
the light churning of the water running in the glen and the deep
organ song of the everlasting sea.</p>
<p>"What can I do?" I asked myself.</p>
<p>Now that Martin was gone I had begun to understand him. His
silence had betrayed his heart to me even more than his speech
could have done. Towering above him like a frowning mountain was
the fact that I was a married woman and he was trying to stand
erect in his honour as a man.</p>
<p>"He must be suffering too," I told myself.</p>
<p>That was a new thought to me and it cut me to the quick.</p>
<p>When it came to me first I wanted to run after him and throw
myself into his arms, and then I wanted to run away from him
altogether.</p>
<p>I felt as if I were on the brink of two madnesses&mdash;the
madness of breaking my marriage vows and the madness of breaking
the heart of the man who loved me.</p>
<p>"Oh, what can I do?" I asked myself again.</p>
<p>I wanted him to go; I wanted him to stay; I did not know what I
wanted. At length I remembered that in ordinary course he would be
going in two days more, and I said to myself:</p>
<p>"Surely I can hold out that long."</p>
<p>But when I put this thought to my breast, thinking it would
comfort me, I found that it burnt like hot iron.</p>
<p>Only two days, and then he would be gone, lost to me perhaps for
ever. Did my renunciation require that? It was terrible!</p>
<p>There was a piano in the room, and to strengthen and console
myself in my trouble I sat down to it and played and sang. I sang
"Ave Maria Stella."</p>
<p>I was singing to myself, so I know I began softly&mdash;so
softly that my voice must have been a whisper scarcely audible
outside the room&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Hail thou star of ocean,<br />
Portal of the sky</i>."</p>
<p>But my heart was full and when I came to the verses which always
moved me most&mdash;</p>
<p>"<i>Virgin of all virgins,<br />
To thy shelter take us</i>"&mdash;</p>
<p>my voice, without my knowing it, may have swelled out into the
breathless night until it reached Martin, where he walked on the
dark headland, and sounded to him like a cry that called him
back.</p>
<p>I cannot say. I only know that when with a thickening throat I
had come to an end, and my forehead had fallen on to the key-board,
and there was no other sound in the air but the far-off surging of
the sea. I heard somebody calling me in a soft and tremulous
whisper,</p>
<p>"Mary!"</p>
<p>It was he. I went out to the balcony and there he was on the
lawn below. The light of the room was on him and never before had I
seen his strong face so full of agitation.</p>
<p>"Come down," he said. "I have something to say to you."</p>
<p>I could not resist him. He was my master. I had to obey.</p>
<p>When I reached the bottom of the stairway he took my hand, and I
did not know whether it was his hand or mine that was trembling. He
led me across the lawn to the seat in the shrubbery that almost
faced my windows. In the soft and soundless night I could hear his
footsteps on the turf and the rustle of my dress over the
grass.</p>
<p>We sat, and for a moment he did not speak. Then with a
passionate rush of words he said:</p>
<p>"Mary, I hadn't meant to say what I'm going to say now, but I
can't do anything else. You are in trouble, and I can't stand by
and see you so ill-used. I can't and I won't!"</p>
<p>I tried to answer him, but my throat was fluttering and I could
not speak.</p>
<p>"It's only a few days before I ought to sail, but they may be
enough in which to do something, and if they're not I'll postpone
the expedition or put it off, or send somebody in my place, for go
away I cannot and leave you like this."</p>
<p>I tried to say that he should not do that whatever happened to
me, but still I could not speak.</p>
<p>"Mary. I want to help you. But I can only do so if you give me
the <i>right</i> to do it. Nobody must tell me I'm a meddler,
butting in where I have no business. There are people enough about
you who would be only too ready to do that&mdash;people related to
you by blood and by law."</p>
<p>I knew what he was coming to, for his voice was quivering in my
ears like the string of a bow.</p>
<p>"There is only one sort of right, Mary, that is above the right
of blood, and you know what that is."</p>
<p>My eyes were growing so dim that I could hardly see the face
which was so close to mine.</p>
<p>"Mary," he said, "I have always cared for you. Surely you know
that. By the saints of God I swear there has never been any other
girl for me, and now there never will he. Perhaps I ought to have
told you this before, and I wanted to do so when I met you in Rome.
But it didn't seem fair, and I couldn't bring myself to do it."</p>
<p>His passionate voice was breaking; I thought my heart was
breaking also.</p>
<p>"All I could do I did, but it came to nothing; and now you are
here and you are unhappy, and though it is so late I want to help
you, to rescue you, to drag you out of this horrible situation
before I go away. Let me do it. Give me the right of one you care
enough for to allow him to speak on your behalf."</p>
<p>I knew what that meant. I knew that I was tottering on the very
edge of a precipice, and to save myself I tried to think of Father
Dan, of Martin's mother, of my own mother, and since I could not
speak I struggled to pray.</p>
<p>"Don't say you can't. If you do I shall go away a sorrowful man.
I shall go at once too&mdash;to-night or to-morrow morning at
latest, for my heart bleeds to look at you and I can't stay here
any longer to see you suffer. It is not torture to me&mdash;it's
hell!"</p>
<p>And then the irrepressible, overwhelming, inevitable moment
came. Martin laid hold of my right hand and said in his tremulous
voice:</p>
<p>"Mary . . . Mary . . . I . . . I love you!"</p>
<p>I could hear no more. I could not think or pray or resist any
longer. The bitter struggle was at an end. Before I knew what I was
doing I was dropping my head on to his breast and he with a cry of
joy was gathering me in his arms.</p>
<p>I was his. He had taken his own. Nothing counted in the presence
of our love. To be only we two together&mdash;that was everything.
The world and the world's laws, the Church and the Canons of the
Church were blotted out, forgotten, lost.</p>
<p>For some moments I hardly breathed. I was only conscious that
over my head Martin was saying something that seemed to come to me
with all the deep and wonderful whispers of his heart.</p>
<p>"Then it's true! It's true that you love me! Yes, it's true!
It's true! No one shall hurt you again. Never again! No, by the
Lord God!"</p>
<p>And then suddenly&mdash;as suddenly as the moment of
intoxication had come to me&mdash;I awoke from my delirium. Some
little thing awakened me. I hardly know what it was. Perhaps it was
only the striking of the cuckoo clock in my room.</p>
<p>"What are we doing?" I said.</p>
<p>Everything had rolled back on me&mdash;my marriage, Father Dan's
warning, my promise to Martin's mother.</p>
<p>"Where are we?" I said.</p>
<p>"Hush! Don't speak," said Martin. "Let us think of nothing
to-night&mdash;nothing except our love."</p>
<p>"Don't say that," I answered. "We are not free to love each
other," and then, trying to liberate myself from his encircling
arms I cried:</p>
<p>"God help me! God forgive me!"</p>
<p>"Wait!" said Martin, holding me a moment longer. "I know what
you feel, and I'm not the man to want a girl to wrong her
conscience. But there's one question I must ask you. If you
<i>were</i> free, could you love me then?"</p>
<p>"Don't ask me that. I must not answer it."</p>
<p>"You must and shall," said Martin. "Could you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"That's enough for me&mdash;enough for to-night anyway. Have no
fear. All shall be well. Go to your room now."</p>
<p>He raised me to my feet and led me back to the foot of the
balcony, and there he kissed my hand and let me go.</p>
<p>"Good night!" he said softly.</p>
<p>"Good night!" I answered.</p>
<p>"God bless you, my pure sweet girl!"</p>
<p>At the next moment I was in my room, lying face down on my
bed&mdash;seeing no hope on any side, and sobbing my heart out for
what might have been but for the hard law of my religion and the
cruel tangle of my fate.</p>

"SIXTY_SIXTH_CHAPTER"></a>SIXTY-SIXTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Next morning, Monday morning, while I was breakfasting in my
bedroom, Price came with a message from Martin to say that he was
going into the glen and wished to know if I would go with him.</p>
<p>I knew perfectly what that meant. He wished to tell me what
steps he intended to take towards my divorce, and my heart trembled
with the thought of the answer I had to give him&mdash;that divorce
for me, under any circumstances, was quite impossible.</p>
<p>Sorry as I was for myself I was still more sorry for Martin. I
felt like a judge who had to pronounce sentence upon
him&mdash;dooming his dearest hopes to painful and instant
death.</p>
<p>I could hear him on the lawn with Tommy the Mate, laughing like
a boy let loose from school, and when I went down to him he greeted
me with a cry of joy that was almost heart-breaking.</p>
<p>Our way to the glen was through a field of grass, where the dew
was thick, and, my boots being thin, Martin in his high spirits
wished to carry me across, and it was only with an effort that I
prevented him from doing so.</p>
<p>The glen itself when we reached it (it was called Glen Raa) was
almost cruelly beautiful that day, and remembering what I had to do
in it I thought I should never be able to get it out of my
sight&mdash;with its slumberous gloom like that of a vast
cathedral, its thick arch of overhanging boughs through which the
morning sunlight was streaming slantwards like the light through
the windows of a clerestory, its running water below, its rustling
leaves above, and the chirping of its birds on every side, making a
sound that was like the chanting of a choir in some far-off apse
and the rumbling of their voices in the roof.</p>
<p>Two or three times, as we walked down the glen towards a port
(Port Raa) which lay at the seaward end of it. Martin rallied me on
the settled gravity of my face and then I had to smile, though how
I did so I do not know, for every other minute my heart was in my
mouth, and never more so than when, to make me laugh, he rattled
away in the language of his boyhood, saying:</p>
<p>"Isn't this stunning? Splendiferous, eh?"</p>
<p>When we came out at the mouth of the port, where a line of
little stunted oaks leaned landward as with the memory of many a
winter's storm, Martin said:</p>
<p>"Let us sit down here."</p>
<p>We sat on the sloping bank, with the insects ticking in the
grass, the bees humming in the air, the sea fowl screaming in the
sky, the broad sea in front, and the little bay below, where the
tide, which was going out, had left behind it a sharp reef of black
rocks covered with sea-weed.</p>
<p>A pleasure-steamer passed at that moment with its flags flying,
its awnings spread, its decks crowded with excursionists, and a
brass hand playing one of Sousa's marches, and as soon as it had
gone, Martin said:</p>
<p>"I've been thinking about our affair, Mary, how to go to work
and all that, and of course the first thing we've got to do is to
get a divorce."</p>
<p>I made no answer, and I tried not to look at him by fixing my
eyes upon the sea.</p>
<p>"You have evidence enough, you know, and if you haven't there's
Price&mdash;she has plenty. So, since you've given me the right to
speak for you, dear, I'm going to speak to your father first"</p>
<p>I must have made some half-articulate response, for not
understanding me he said:</p>
<p>"Oh, I know he'll be a hard nut to crack. He won't want to hear
what I've got to say, but he has got to hear it. And after all
you're his daughter, and if he has any bowels of compassion . .
."</p>
<p>Again I must have made some effort to speak, for he said:</p>
<p>"Yes, he's ill, but he has only to set Curphy to work and the
lawyer will do the rest."</p>
<p>I could not allow him to go any further, so I blurted out
somehow that I had seen my father already.</p>
<p>"On this subject?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And what did he say?"</p>
<p>I told him as well as I could what my father had said, being
ashamed to repeat it.</p>
<p>"That was only bluff, though," said Martin. "The real truth is
that you would cease to be Lady Raa and that would be a blow to his
pride. Then there would no longer be any possibility of
establishing a family and that would disturb his plans. No matter!
We can set Curphy to work ourselves."</p>
<p>"But I have seen Mr. Curphy also," I said.</p>
<p>"And what did <i>he</i> say?"</p>
<p>I told him what the lawyer had said and he was aghast.</p>
<p>"Good heavens! What an iniquity! In England too! But never mind!
There are other countries where this relic of the barbaric ages
doesn't exist. We'll go there. We must get you a divorce
somehow."</p>
<p>My time had come. I could keep back the truth no longer.</p>
<p>"But Martin," I said, "divorce is impossible for me&mdash;quite
impossible."</p>
<p>And then I told him that I had been to see the Bishop also, and
he had said what I had known before, though in the pain of my
temptation I had forgotten it, that the Catholic Church did not
countenance divorce under any circumstances, because God made
marriages and therefore no man could dissolve them.</p>
<p>Martin listened intently, and in his eagerness to catch every
word he raised himself to a kneeling position by my side, so that
he was looking into my face.</p>
<p>"But Mary, my dear Mary," he said, "you don't mean to say you
will allow such considerations to influence you?"</p>
<p>"I am a Catholic&mdash;what else can I do?" I said.</p>
<p>"But think&mdash;my dear, dear girl, think how unreasonable, how
untrue, how preposterous it all is in a case like yours? God made
your marriage? Yours? God married you to that notorious profligate?
Can you believe it?"</p>
<p>His eyes were flaming. I dared not look at them.</p>
<p>"Then think again. They say there's no divorce in the Catholic
Church, do they? But what are they talking about? Morally speaking
you are a divorced woman already. Anybody with an ounce of brains
can see that. When you were married to this man he made a contract
with you, and he has broken the terms of it, hasn't he? Then
where's the contract now? It doesn't any longer exist. Your husband
has destroyed it."</p>
<p>"But isn't marriage different?" I asked.</p>
<p>And then I tried to tell him what the Bishop had said of the
contract of marriage being unlike any other contract because God
Himself had become a party to it.</p>
<p>"What?" he cried. "God become a party to a marriage like yours?
My dear girl, only think! Think of what your marriage has
been&mdash;the pride and vanity and self-seeking that conceived it,
the compulsion that was put upon you to carry it through, and then
the shame and the suffering and the wickedness and the sin of it!
Was God a party to the making of a marriage like that?"</p>
<p>In his agitation he rose, walked two or three paces in front and
came back to me.</p>
<p>"Then think what it means if your marriage may not be dissolved.
It means that you must go on living with this man whose life is so
degrading. Year in, year out, as long as your life lasts you must
let him humiliate and corrupt you with his company, his companions
and his example, until you are dragged down, down, down to the
filth he lives in himself, and your very soul is contaminated. Is
that what the Church asks of you?"</p>
<p>I answered no, and tried to tell him what the Bishop had told me
about separation, but he interrupted me with a shout.</p>
<p>"Separation? Did he say that? If the Church has no right to
divorce you what right has it to separate you? Oh, I see what it
will say&mdash;hope of reconciliation. But if you were separated
from your husband would you ever go back to him? Never in this
world. Then what would your separation be? Only divorce under
another name."</p>
<p>I was utterly shaken. Perhaps I wanted to believe what Martin
was saying; perhaps I did not know enough to answer him, but I
could not help it if I thought Martin's clear mind was making dust
and ashes of everything that Father Dan and the Bishop had said to
me.</p>
<p>"Then what can I do?" I asked.</p>
<p>I thought his face quivered at that question. He got up again,
and stood before me for a moment without speaking. Then he said,
with an obvious effort&mdash;</p>
<p>"If your Church will not allow you to divorce your husband, and
if you and I cannot marry without that, then . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"I didn't mean to propose it . . . God knows I didn't, but when
a woman . . . when a woman has been forced into a loveless
marriage, and it is crushing the very soul out of her, and the iron
law of her Church will not permit her to escape from it, what crime
does she commit if she . . ."</p>
<p>"Well?" I asked, though I saw what he was going to say.</p>
<p>"Mary," he said, breathing, hard and fast, "you must come to
me."</p>
<p>I made a sudden cry, though I tried not to.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know," he said. "It's not what we could wish. But we'll
be open about it. We'll face it out. Why shouldn't we? I shall
anyway. And if your father and the Bishop say anything to me I'll
tell them what I think of the abominable marriage they forced you
into. As for you, dear, I know you'll have to bear something. All
the conventional canting hypocrisies! Every man who has bought his
wife, and every woman who has sold herself into
concubinage&mdash;there are thousands and thousands of them all the
world over, and they'll try . . . perhaps they'll try . . . but let
them try. If they want to trample the life out of you they'll have
to walk over me first&mdash;yes, by God they will!"</p>
<p>"But Martin . . ."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Do you mean that I . . . I am . . . to . . . to live with you
without marriage?"</p>
<p>"It's the only thing possible, isn't it?" he said. And then he
tried to show me that love was everything, and if people loved each
other nothing else mattered&mdash;religious ceremonies were
nothing, the morality of society was nothing, the world and its
back-biting was nothing.</p>
<p>The great moment had come for me at last, and though I felt torn
between love and pity I had to face it.</p>
<p>"Martin, I . . . I can't do it," I said.</p>
<p>He looked steadfastly into my face for a moment, but I dare not
look back, for I knew he was suffering.</p>
<p>"You think it would be wrong?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"A sin?"</p>
<p>I tried to say "Yes" again, but my reply died in my throat.</p>
<p>There was another moment of silence and then, in a faltering
voice that nearly broke me down, he said:</p>
<p>"In that case there is nothing more to say. . . . There isn't,
is there?"</p>
<p>I made an effort to speak, but my voice would not come.</p>
<p>"I thought . . . as there was no other way of escape from this
terrible marriage . . . but if you think . . ."</p>
<p>He stopped, and then coming closer he said:</p>
<p>"I suppose you know what this means for you, Mary&mdash;that
after all the degradation you have gone through you are shutting
the door to a worthier, purer life, and that . . ."</p>
<p>I could bear no more. My heart was yearning for him, yet I was
compelled to speak.</p>
<p>"But would it be a purer life, Martin, if it began in sin? No,
no, it wouldn't, it couldn't. Oh, you can't think how hard it is to
deny myself the happiness you offer me. It's harder than all the
miseries my husband has inflicted upon me. But it wouldn't be
happiness, because our sin would stand between us. That would
always be there, Martin&mdash;every day, every night, as long as
ever we lived. . . . We should never know one really happy hour.
I'm sure we should not. I should be unhappy myself and I should
make you unhappy. Oh, I daren't! I daren't! Don't ask me, I
beg&mdash;I beseech you."</p>
<p>I burst into tears after this, and there was a long silence
between us. Then Martin touched my arm and said with a gentleness
that nearly broke my heart:</p>
<p>"Don't cry, Mary. I give in. I find I have no will but yours,
dear. If <i>you</i> can bear the present condition of things, I
ought to be able to. Let us go back to the house."</p>
<p>He raised me to my feet and we turned our faces homeward. All
the brightness of the day had gone for both of us by this time. The
tide was now far out. Its moaning was only a distant murmur. The
shore was a stretch of jagged black rocks covered with
sea-weed.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SIXTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"SIXTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER"></a>SIXTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Notwithstanding Martin's tenderness I had a vague fear that he
had only pretended to submit to my will, and before the day was
over I had proof of it.</p>
<p>During dinner we spoke very little, and after it was over we
went out to the balcony to sit on a big oak seat which stood
there.</p>
<p>It was another soft and soundless night, without stars, very
dark, and with an empty echoing air, which seemed to say that
thunder was not far off, for the churning of the nightjar vibrated
from the glen, and the distant roar of the tide, now rising, was
like the rumble of drums at a soldier's funeral.</p>
<p>Just as we sat down the pleasure-steamer we had seen in the
morning re-crossed our breadth of sea on its way back to
Blackwater; and lit up on deck and in all its port-holes, it looked
like a floating <i>caf&eacute; chantant</i> full of happy people,
for they were singing in chorus a rugged song which Martin and I
had known all our lives&mdash;</p>
<p><i>Ramsey town, Ramsey town, smiling by the sea,<br />
Here's a health to my true love, wheresoe'er she be</i>.</p>
<p>When the steamer had passed into darkness, Martin said:</p>
<p>"I don't want to hurt you again, Mary, but before I go there's
something I want to know. . . . If you cannot divorce your husband,
and if . . . if you cannot come to me what . . . what is left to
us?"</p>
<p>I tried to tell him there was only one thing left to us, and (as
much for myself as for him) I did my best to picture the spiritual
heights and beauties of renunciation.</p>
<p>"Does that mean that we are to . . . to part?" he said. "You
going your way and I going mine . . . never to meet again?"</p>
<p>That cut me to the quick, so I said&mdash;it was all I could
trust myself to say&mdash;that the utmost that was expected of us
was that we should govern our affections&mdash;control and conquer
them.</p>
<p>"Do you mean that we are to stamp them out altogether?" he
said.</p>
<p>That cut me to the quick too, and I felt like a torn bird that
is struggling in the lime, but I contrived to say that if our love
was guilty love it was our duty to destroy it.</p>
<p>"Is that possible?" he said.</p>
<p>"We must ask God to help us," I answered, and then, while his
head was down and I was looking out into the darkness, I tried to
say that though he was suffering now he would soon get over this
disappointment.</p>
<p>"Do you <i>wish</i> me to get over it?" he asked.</p>
<p>This confused me terribly, for in spite of all I was saying I
knew at the bottom of my heart that in the sense he intended I did
not and could not wish it.</p>
<p>"We have known and cared for each other all our lives,
Mary&mdash;isn't that so? It seems as if there never was a time
when we didn't know and care for each other. Are we to pray to God,
as you say, that a time may come when we shall feel as if we had
never known and cared for each other at all?"</p>
<p>My throat was fluttering&mdash;I could not answer him.</p>
<p>"<i>I</i> can't," he said. "I never shall&mdash;never as long as
I live. No prayers will ever help me to forget you."</p>
<p>I could not speak. I dared not look at him. After a moment he
said in a thicker voice:</p>
<p>"And you . . . will you be able to forget <i>me</i>? By praying
to God will you be able to wipe me out of your mind?"</p>
<p>I felt as if something were strangling me.</p>
<p>"A woman lives in her heart, doesn't she?" he said. "Love is
everything to her . . . everything except her religion. Will it be
possible&mdash;this renunciation . . . will it be possible for you
either?"</p>
<p>I felt as if all the blood in my body were running away from
me.</p>
<p>"It will not. You know it will not. You will never be able to
renounce your love. Neither of us will he able to renounce it. It
isn't possible. It isn't human. . . . Well, what then? If we
continue to love each other&mdash;you here and I down
there&mdash;we shall be just as guilty in the eyes of the Church,
shan't we?"</p>
<p>I did not answer him, and after a moment he came closer to me on
the seat and said almost in a whisper:</p>
<p>"Then think again, Mary. Only give one glance to the horrible
life that is before you when I am gone. You have been married a
year . . . only a year . . . and you have suffered terribly. But
there is worse to come. Your husband's coarse infidelity has been
shocking, but there will be something more shocking than his
infidelity&mdash;his affection. Have you never thought of
<i>that</i>?"</p>
<p>I started and shuddered, feeling as if somebody must have told
him the most intimate secret of my life. Coming still closer he
said:</p>
<p>"Forgive me, dear. I'm bound to speak plainly now. If I didn't I
should never forgive myself in the future . . . Listen! Your
husband will get over his fancy for this . . . this woman. He'll
throw her off, as he has thrown off women of the same kind before.
What will happen then? He'll remember that you belong to him . . .
that he has rights in you . . . that you are his wife and he is
your husband . . . that the infernal law which denies you the
position of an equal human being gives him a right&mdash;a legal
right&mdash;to compel your obedience. Have you never thought of
<i>that</i>?"</p>
<p>For one moment we looked into each other's eyes; then he took
hold of my hand and, speaking very rapidly, said:</p>
<p>"That's the life that is before you when I am gone&mdash;to live
with this man whom you loathe . . . year after year, as long as
life lasts . . . occupying the same house, the same room, the same
. . ."</p>
<p>I uttered an involuntary cry and he stopped.</p>
<p>"Martin," I said, "there is something you don't know."</p>
<p>And then, I told him&mdash;it was forced out of me&mdash;my
modesty went down in the fierce battle with a higher pain, and I do
not know whether it was my pride or my shame or my love that
compelled me to tell him, but I <i>did</i> tell him&mdash;God knows
how&mdash;that I could not run the risk he referred to because I
was not in that sense my husband's wife and never had been.</p>
<p>The light was behind me, and my face was in the darkness; but
still I covered it with my hands while I stammered out the story of
my marriage day and the day after, and of the compact I had entered
into with my husband that only when and if I came to love him
should he claim my submission as a wife.</p>
<p>While I was speaking I knew that Martin's eyes were fixed on me,
for I could feel his breath on the back of my hands, but before I
had finished he leapt up and cried excitedly:</p>
<p>"And that compact has been kept?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Then it's all right! Don't be afraid. You shall be free. Come
in and let me tell you how! Come in, come in!"</p>
<p>He took me back into the boudoir. I had no power to resist him.
His face was as pale as death, but his eyes were shining. He made
me sit down and then sat on the table in front of me.</p>
<p>"Listen!" he said. "When I bought my ship from the Lieutenant we
signed a deed, a contract, as a witness before all men that he
would give me his ship and I would give him some money. But if
after all he hadn't given me his ship what would our deed have
been? Only so much waste paper."</p>
<p>It was the same with my marriage. If it had been an honest
contract, the marriage service would have been a witness before God
that we meant to live together as man and wife. But I never had,
therefore what was the marriage service? Only an empty
ceremony!</p>
<p>"That's the plain sense of the matter, isn't it?" he cried. "I
defy any priest in the world to prove the contrary."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Well, don't you see what it comes to? You are
free&mdash;morally free at all events. You can come to me. You
must, too. I daren't leave you in this house any longer. I shall
take you to London and fix you up there, and then, when I tome back
from the Antarctic . . ."</p>
<p>He was glowing with joy, but a cold hand suddenly seized me, for
I had remembered all the terrors of excommunication as Father Dan
had described them.</p>
<p>"But Martin," I said, "would the Church accept that?"</p>
<p>"What matter whether it would or wouldn't? Our consciences would
be clear. There would be no sin, and what you were saying this
morning would not apply."</p>
<p>"But if I left my husband I couldn't marry you, could I?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps not."</p>
<p>"Then the Church would say that I was a sinful woman living a
sinful life, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>"But you wouldn't be."</p>
<p>"All the same the Church would say so, and if it did I should be
cut out of communion, and if I were cut out of communion I should
be cast out of the Church, and if I were cast out of the Church . .
. what would become of me then?"</p>
<p>"But, my dear, dear girl," said Martin, "don't you see that this
is not the same thing at all? It is only a case of a ceremony. And
why should a mere ceremony&mdash;even if we cannot do away with
it&mdash;darken a woman's life for ever?"</p>
<p>My heart was yearning for love, but my soul was crying out for
salvation; and not being able to answer him for myself, I told him
what Father Dan had said I was to say.</p>
<p>"Father Dan is a saint and I love him," he said. "But what can
he know&mdash;what can any priest know of a situation like this?
The law of man has tied you to this brute, but the law of God has
given you to me. Why should a marriage service stand between
us?"</p>
<p>"But it does," I said. "And we can't alter it. No, no, I dare
not break the law of the Church. I am a weak, wretched girl, but I
cannot give up my religion."</p>
<p>After that Martin did not speak for a moment. Then he said:</p>
<p>"You mean that, Mary?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>And then my heart accused me so terribly of the crime of
resisting him that I took his hand and held his fingers in a tight
lock while I told him&mdash;what I had never meant to
tell&mdash;how long and how deeply I had loved him, but
nevertheless I dared not face the thought of living and dying
without the consolations of the Church.</p>
<p>"I dare not! I dare not!" I said. "I should be a broken-hearted
woman if I did, and you don't want that, do you?"</p>
<p>He listened in silence, though the irregular lines in his face
showed the disordered state of his soul, and when I had finished a
wild look came into his eyes and he said:</p>
<p>"I am disappointed in you, Mary. I thought you were brave and
fearless, and that when I showed you a way out of your miserable
entanglement you would take it in spite of everything."</p>
<p>His voice was growing thick again. I could scarcely bear to
listen to it.</p>
<p>"Do you suppose I wanted to take up the position I proposed to
you? Not I. No decent man ever does. But I love you so dearly that
I was willing to make that sacrifice and count it as nothing if
only I could rescue you from the misery of your abominable
marriage."</p>
<p>Then he broke into a kind of fierce laughter, and said:</p>
<p>"It seems I wasn't wanted, though. You say in effect that my
love is sinful and criminal, and that it will imperil your soul. So
I'm only making mischief here and the sooner I get away the better
for everybody."</p>
<p>He threw off my hand, stepped to the door to the balcony, and
looking out into the darkness said, between choking laughter and
sobs:</p>
<p>"Ellan, you are no place for me. I can't bear the sight of you
any longer. I used to think you were the dearest spot on earth,
because you were the home of her who would follow me to the ends of
the earth if I wanted her, but I was wrong. She loves me less than
a wretched ceremony, and would sacrifice my happiness to a
miserable bit of parchment."</p>
<p>My heart was clamouring loud. Never had I loved him so much as
now. I had to struggle with myself not to throw myself into his
arms.</p>
<p>"No matter!" he said. "I should be a poor-spirited fool to stay
where I'm not wanted. I must get back to my work. The sooner the
better, too. I thought I should be counting the days down there
until I could come home again. But why should I? And why should I
care what happens to me? It's all as one now."</p>
<p>He stepped back from the balcony with a resolute expression on
his gloomy face, and I thought for a moment (half hoping and half
fearing it) that he was going to lay hold of me and tell me I must
do what he wished because I belonged to him.</p>
<p>But he only looked at me for a moment in silence, and then burst
into a flood of tears, and turned and ran out of the house.</p>
<p>Let who will say his tears were unmanly. To me they were the
bitter cry of a great heart, and I wanted to follow him and say,
"Take me. Do what you like with me. I am yours."</p>
<p>I did not do so. I sat a long time where he had left me and then
I went into my room and locked the door.</p>
<p>I did not cry. Unjust and cruel as his reproaches had been, I
began to have a strange wild joy in them. I knew that he would not
have insulted me like that if he had not loved me to the very verge
of madness itself.</p>
<p>Hours passed. Price came tapping at my door to ask if she should
lock up the house&mdash;meaning the balcony. I answered "No, go to
bed."</p>
<p>I heard the deadened thud of Martin's footsteps on the lawn
passing to and fro. Sometimes they paused under my window and then
I had a feeling, amounting to certainty, that he was listening to
hear if I was sobbing, and that if I had been he would have broken
down my bedroom door to get to me.</p>
<p>At length I heard him come up the stone stairway, shut and bolt
the balcony door, and walk heavily across the corridor to his own
room.</p>
<p>The day was then dawning. It was four o'clock.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SIXTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER" id=
"SIXTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER"></a>SIXTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I awoke on Wednesday morning in a kind of spiritual and physical
fever. Every conflicting emotion which a woman can experience in
the cruel battle between her religion and her love seemed to flood
body and soul&mdash;joy, pain, pride, shame, fear, rapture&mdash;so
that I determined (not without cause) to make excuse of a headache
to stay in bed.</p>
<p>Although it was the last day of Martin's visit, and I charged
myself with the discourtesy of neglecting him, as well as the folly
of losing the few remaining hours of his company, I thought I could
not without danger meet him again.</p>
<p>I was afraid of him, but I was still more afraid of myself.</p>
<p>Recalling my last sight of his face as he ran out of the house,
and knowing well the desire of my own heart, I felt that if I spent
another day in his company it would be impossible to say what might
happen.</p>
<p>As a result of this riot of emotions I resolved to remain all
day in my room, and towards evening to send out a letter bidding
him good-bye and good-luck. It would be a cold end to a long
friendship and my heart was almost frozen at the thought of it, but
it was all I dared do and I saw no help for it.</p>
<p>But how little did I know what was written in the Book of Fate
for me!</p>
<p>First came Price on pretence of bathing my forehead, and she
bombarded me with accounts of Martin's anxiety. When he had heard
that I was ill he had turned as white as if sixteen ounces of blood
had been taken out of him. It nearly broke me up to hear that, but
Price, who was artful, only laughed and said:</p>
<p>"Men <i>are</i> such funny things, bless them! To think of that
fine young man, who is big enough to fell an ox and brave enough to
face a lion, being scared to death because a little lady has a
headache."</p>
<p>All morning she was in and out of my room with similar stories,
and towards noon she brought me a bunch of roses wet with the dew,
saying that Tommy the Mate had sent them.</p>
<p>"Are you sure it was Tommy the Mate?" I asked, whereupon the sly
thing, who was only waiting to tell the truth, though she pretended
that I was forcing it out of her, admitted that the flowers were
from Martin, and that he had told her not to say so.</p>
<p>"What's he doing now?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Writing a letter," said Price, "and judging by the times he has
torn it up and started again and wiped his forehead, it must be a
tough job, I can tell you."</p>
<p>I thought I knew whom the letter was meant for, and before
luncheon it came up to me.</p>
<p>It was the first love letter I had ever had from Martin, and it
melted me like wax over a candle. I have it still, and though
Martin is such a great man now, I am tempted to copy it out just as
it was written with all its appearance of irreverence (none, I am
sure, was intended), and even its bad spelling, for without that it
would not be Martin&mdash;my boy who could never learn his
lessons.</p>
<p>"<i>Dear Mary,&mdash;I am destroyed to here how ill you are, and
when I think it's all my fault I am ready to kick myself</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Don't worry about what I was saying last night. I was mad to
think what might happen to you while I should be down there, but
I've been thinking it over since and I've come to the conclusion
that if their is anything to God He can be trusted to look after
you without any help from me, so when we meet again before I go
away we'll never say another word on the subject&mdash;that's a
promice</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>I can't go until your better though, so I'm just sending the
jaunting car into town with a telegram to London telling them to
postpone the expedision on account of illness, and if they think
it's mine it won't matter because it's something worse</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>But if you are realy a bit better, as your maid says, you
might come to the window and wave your hand to me, and I shall be
as happy as a sand-boy</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Yours</i>,</p>
<p>"<i>Mart</i>."</p>
<p>To this letter (forgetting my former fears) I returned an
immediate verbal reply, saying I was getting better rapidly and
hoped to be up to dinner, so he must not send that telegram to
London on any account, seeing that nobody knew what was going to
happen and everything was in the hands of God.</p>
<p>Price took my message with a knowing smile at the corner of her
mouth, and a few minutes afterwards I heard Martin laughing with
Tommy the Mate at the other end of the lawn.</p>
<p>I don't know why I took so much pains with my dress that night.
I did not expect to see Martin again. I was sending him away from
me. Yet never before had I dressed myself with so much care. I put
on the soft white satin gown which was made for me in Cairo, a
string of pearls over my hair, and another (a tight one) about my
neck.</p>
<p>Martin was waiting for me in the boudoir, and to my surprise he
had dressed too, but, except that he wore a soft silk shirt, I did
not know what he was wearing, or whether he looked handsome or not,
because it was Martin and that was all that mattered to me.</p>
<p>I am sure my footstep was light as I entered the room, for I was
shod in white satin slippers, but Martin heard it, and I saw his
eyes fluttering as he looked at me, and said something sweet about
a silvery fir tree with its little dark head against the sky.</p>
<p>"It's to be a truce, isn't it?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes, a truce," I answered, which meant that as this was to be
our last evening together all painful subjects were to be put
aside.</p>
<p>Before we sat down to eat he took me out on to the balcony to
look at the sea, for though there was no rain flashes of sheet
lightning with low rumbling of distant thunder lit up the water for
a moment with visions of heavenly beauty, and then were devoured by
the grim and greedy darkness.</p>
<p>During dinner we kept faith with each other. In order to avoid
the one subject that was uppermost in both our minds, we played at
being children, and pretended it was the day we sailed to St.
Mary's Rock.</p>
<p>Thinking back to that time, and all the incidents which he had
thought so heroic and I so tragic, we dropped into the vernacular,
and I called him "boy" and he called me "bogh millish," and at
every racy word that came up from the forgotten cells of our brains
we shrieked with laughter.</p>
<p>When Martin spoke of his skipper I asked "Is he a stunner?" When
he mentioned one of his scientific experts I inquired "Is he any
good?" And after he had told me that he hoped to take possession of
some island in the name of the English crown, and raise the Union
Jack on it, I said: "Do or die, we allus does that when we're out
asploring."</p>
<p>How we laughed! He laughed because I laughed, and I laughed
because he was laughing. I had some delicious moments of femininity
too (such as no woman can resist), until it struck me suddenly that
in all this make-believe we were making love to each other again.
That frightened me for a time, but I told myself that everything
was safe as long as we could carry on the game.</p>
<p>It was not always easy to do so, though, for some of our
laughter had tears behind it, and some of our memories had an
unexpected sting, because things had a meaning for us now which
they never had before, and we were compelled to realise what life
had done for us.</p>
<p>Thus I found my throat throbbing when I recalled the loss of our
boat, leaving us alone together on that cruel rock with the rising
tide threatening to submerge us, and I nearly choked when I
repeated my last despairing cry: "I'm not a stunner! . . . and
you'll have to give me up . . . and leave me here, and save
yourself."</p>
<p>It was like walking over a solfataro with the thin hot earth
ready to break up under our feet.</p>
<p>To escape from it I sat down at the piano and began to sing. I
dared not sing the music I loved best&mdash;the solemn music of the
convent&mdash;so I sang some of the nonsense songs I had heard in
the streets. At one moment I twisted round on the piano stool and
said:</p>
<p>"I'll bet you anything"&mdash;(I always caught Martin's tone in
Martin's company), "you can't remember the song I sang sitting in
the boat with William Rufus on my lap."</p>
<p>"I'll bet you anything I can," said Martin.</p>
<p>"Oh, no, you can't," I said.</p>
<p>"Have it as you like, bogh, but sing it for all," said Martin,
and then I sang&mdash;</p>
<p><i>"Oh, Sally's the gel for me,<br />
Our Sally's the gel for me,<br />
I'll marry the gel that I love best,<br />
When I come back from sea."</i></p>
<p>But that arrow of memory had been sharpened on Time's grindstone
and it seemed to pierce through us, so Martin proposed that we
should try the rollicking chorus which the excursionists had sung
on the pleasure-steamer the night before.</p>
<p>He did not know a note of music and he had no more voice than a
corn-crake, but crushing up on to the music-stool by my side, he
banged away with his left hand while I played with my right, and we
sang together in a wild delightful discord&mdash;</p>
<p><i>"Ramsey town, Ramsey town, smiling by the sea,<br />
Here's a health to my true love, wheresoe'er she be."</i></p>
<p>We laughed again when that was over, but I knew I could not keep
it up much longer, and every now and then I forgot that I was in my
boudoir and seemed to see that lonesome plateau, twelve thousand
feet above the icy barrier that guards the Pole, and Martin toiling
through blizzards over rolling waves of snow.</p>
<p>Towards midnight we went out on to the balcony to look at the
lightning for the last time. The thunder was shaking the cliffs and
rolling along them like cannon-balls, and Martin said:</p>
<p>"It sounds like the breaking of the ice down there."</p>
<p>When we returned to the room he told me he would have to be off
early in the morning, before I was out of bed, having something to
do in Blackwater, where "the boys were getting up a spree of some
sort."</p>
<p>In this way he rattled on for some minutes, obviously talking
himself down and trying to prevent me from thinking. But the grim
moment came at last, and it was like the empty gap of time when you
are waiting for the whirring of the clock that is to tell the end
of the old year and the beginning of the new.</p>
<p>My cuckoo clock struck twelve. Martin looked at me. I looked at
him. Our eyes fell. He took my hand. It was cold and moist. His own
was hot and trembling.</p>
<p>"So this is . . . the end," he said.</p>
<p>"Yes . . . the end," I answered.</p>
<p>"Well, we've had a jolly evening to finish up with, anyway," he
said. "I shall always remember it."</p>
<p>I tried to say he would soon have other evenings to think about
that would make him forget this one.</p>
<p>"Never in this world!" he answered.</p>
<p>I tried to wish him good luck, and great success, and a happy
return to fame and fortune. He looked at me with his great liquid
eyes and said:</p>
<p>"Aw, well, that's all as one now."</p>
<p>I tried to tell him it would always be a joy to me to remember
that he and I had been such great, great friends.</p>
<p>He looked at me again, and answered:</p>
<p>"That's all as one also."</p>
<p>I reproached myself for the pain I was causing him, and to keep
myself in countenance I began to talk of the beauty and nobility of
renunciation&mdash;each sacrificing for the other's sake all sinful
thoughts and desires.</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm doing what you wish," he said. "I can't deny you
anything."</p>
<p>That cut me deep, so I went on to say that if I had acted
otherwise I should always have had behind me the memory of the vows
I had broken, the sacrament I had violated, and the faith I had
abandoned.</p>
<p>"All the same we might have been very happy," he said, and then
my throat became so thick that I could not say any more.</p>
<p>After a few moments he said:</p>
<p>"It breaks my heart to leave you. But I suppose I must, though I
don't know what is going to happen."</p>
<p>"All that is in God's hands," I said.</p>
<p>"Yes," said Martin, "it's up to Him now."</p>
<p>It made my heart ache to look at his desolate face, so,
struggling hard with my voice, I tried to tell him he must not
despair.</p>
<p>"You are so young," I said. "Surely the future holds much
happiness for you."</p>
<p>And then, though I knew that the bare idea of another woman
taking the love I was turning away would have made the world a
blank for me, I actually said something about the purest joys of
love falling to his lot some day.</p>
<p>"No, by the Lord God," said Martin. "There'll be no other woman
for me. If I'm not to have you I'll wear the willow for you the
same as if you were dead."</p>
<p>There was a certain pain in that, but there was a thrill of
secret joy in it too.</p>
<p>He was still holding my hand. We held each other's hands a long
time. In spite of my affected resignation I could not let his hand
go. I felt as if I were a drowning woman and his hand were my only
safety. Nevertheless I said:</p>
<p>"We must say good-night and good-bye now."</p>
<p>"And if it is for ever?"</p>
<p>"Don't say that."</p>
<p>"But if it is?"</p>
<p>"Well, then . . . for ever."</p>
<p>"At least give me something to take away with me," he said.</p>
<p>"Better not," I answered, but even as I spoke I dropped the
handkerchief which I had been holding in my other hand and he
picked it up.</p>
<p>I knew that my tears, though I was trying to keep them back,
were trickling down my cheeks. I saw that his face was all broken
up as it had been the night before.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence in which I was conscious of
nothing but the fierce beating of my pulse, and then he raised my
hand to his lips, dropped it gently and walked over to the
door.</p>
<p>But after he had opened it he turned and looked at me. I looked
at him, longing, craving, hungering for his love as for a flame at
which my heart could warm itself.</p>
<p>Then came a blinding moment. It seemed as if in an instant he
lost all control of himself, and his love came rushing upon him
like a mighty surging river.</p>
<p>Flinging the door back he returned to me with long strides, and
snatching me up in his great arms, he lifted me off my feet,
clasped me tightly to him, kissed me passionately on the mouth and
cried in a quivering, husky voice:</p>
<p>"You are my wife. I am your real husband. I am not leaving you
because you are married to this brute, but for the sake of your
soul. We love each other. We shall continue to love each other. No
matter where you are, or what they do with you, you are mine and
always will be."</p>
<p>My blood was boiling. The world was reeling round me. There was
a roaring in my brain. All my spiritual impulses had gone. I was a
woman, and it was the same to me as if the primordial man had taken
possession of me by sheer force. Yet I was not afraid of that. I
rejoiced in it. I wanted to give myself up to it.</p>
<p>But the next moment Martin had dropped me, and fled from the
room, clashing the door behind him.</p>
<p>I felt as if a part of myself had been torn from my breast and
had gone out with him.</p>
<p>The room seemed to become dark.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SIXTY_NINTH_CHAPTER" id=
"SIXTY_NINTH_CHAPTER"></a>SIXTY-NINTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>For a moment I stood where Martin had left me, throbbing through
and through like an open wound, telling myself that he had gone,
that I should never see him again, and that I had driven him away
from me.</p>
<p>Those passionate kisses had deprived me of the power of
consecutive thought. I could only feel. And the one thing I felt
above everything else was that the remedy I had proposed to myself
for my unhappy situation&mdash;renunciation&mdash;was impossible,
because Martin was a part of my own being and without him I could
not live.</p>
<p>"Martin! Martin! My love! My love!" cried the voice of my
heart.</p>
<p>In fear lest I had spoken the words aloud, and in terror of what
I might do under the power of them, I hurried into my bedroom and
locked and bolted the door.</p>
<p>But the heart knows nothing of locks and bolts, and a moment
afterwards my spirit was following Martin to his room. I was seeing
him as I had seen him last, with his face full of despair, and I
was accusing myself of the pain I had caused him.</p>
<p>I had conquered Martin, but I had conquered myself also. I had
compelled him to submit, but his submission had vanquished me.</p>
<p>Even if I had a right to impose renunciation on myself, what
right had I to impose it upon him, who did not desire it, did not
think it necessary, was not reconciled to it, and only accepted it
out of obedience to my will?</p>
<p>He loved me. No man ever loved a woman more dearly. He deserved
to be loved in return. He had done nothing to forfeit love. He was
bound by no ties. And yet I was driving him away from me. What
right had I to do so?</p>
<p>I began to see that I had acted throughout with the most
abominable selfishness. In his great love he had said little or
nothing about himself. But why had <i>I</i> not thought of him? In
the struggles of my religious conscience I had been thinking of
myself alone, but Martin had been suffering too, and I had never
once really thought of that? What <i>right</i> had I to make him
suffer?</p>
<p>After a while I began to prepare for bed, but it took me long to
undress, for I stopped every moment to think.</p>
<p>I thought of the long years Martin had been waiting for me and
while I was telling myself that he had kept pure for my sake, my
heart was beating so fast that I could hardly bear the strain of
it.</p>
<p>It cut me still deeper to think that even as there had been no
other woman for him in the past so there would be no other in the
future. Never as long as he lived! I was as sure of that as of the
breath I breathed, and when I remembered what he had said about
wearing the willow for me as if I were dead I was almost
distracted.</p>
<p>His despairing words kept ringing mercilessly in my
ears&mdash;"It's all as one now"; "How happy we might have been." I
wanted to go to him and tell him that though I was sending him away
still I loved him, and it was <i>because</i> I loved him that I was
sending him away.</p>
<p>I had made one step towards the door before I remembered that it
was too late to carry out my purpose. The opportunity had passed.
Martin had gone to his room. He might even be in bed by this
time.</p>
<p>But there are spiritual influences which control our bodies
independently of our will. I put on my dressing-gown (being partly
undressed) and went back to the boudoir. I hardly knew what impulse
impelled me to do so, and neither do I know why I went from the
boudoir to the balcony unless it was in hope of the melancholy joy
of standing once more where Martin and I had stood together a
little while ago.</p>
<p>I was alone now. The low thunder was still rolling along the
cliffs, but I hardly heard it. The white sheet lightning was still
pulsing in the sky and rising, as it seemed, out of the sea, but I
hardly saw it.</p>
<p>At one moment I caught a glimpse of a solitary fishing boat,
under its brown lugger sails, heading towards Blackwater; at the
next moment my eyes were dazzled as by a flashlight from some
unseen battleship.</p>
<p>Leaning over the balcony and gazing into the intermittent
darkness I pictured to myself the barren desolation of Martin's
life after he had left me. Loving me so much he might fall into
some excess, perhaps some vice, and if that happened what would be
the measure of my responsibility?</p>
<p>Losing me he might lose his faith in God. I had read of men
becoming spiritual castaways after they had lost their anchorage in
some great love, and I asked myself what should I do if Martin
became an infidel.</p>
<p>And when I told myself that I could only save Martin's soul by
sacrificing my own I was overwhelmed by a love so great that I
thought I could do even that.</p>
<p>"Martin! Martin! Forgive me, forgive me," I cried.</p>
<p>I felt so hot that I opened my dressing-gown to cool my bare
breast. After a while I began to shiver and then fearing I might
take cold I went back to the boudoir, and sat down.</p>
<p>I looked at my cuckoo clock. It was half-past twelve. Only half
an hour since Martin had left me! It seemed like hours and hours.
What of the years and years of my life that I had still to spend
without him?</p>
<p>The room was so terribly silent, yet it seemed to be full of our
dead laughter. The ghost of our happiness seemed to haunt it. I was
sure I could never live in it again.</p>
<p>I wondered what Martin would be doing now. Would he be in bed
and asleep, or sitting up like this, and thinking of me as I was
thinking of him?</p>
<p>At one moment I thought I heard his footsteps. I listened, but
the sound stopped. At another moment, covering my face with my
hands, I thought I saw him in his room, as plainly as if there were
no walls dividing us. He was holding out his hands to me, and his
face had the yearning, loving, despairing expression which it had
worn when he looked back at me from the door.</p>
<p>At yet another moment I thought I heard him calling me.</p>
<p>"Mary!"</p>
<p>I listened again, but again all was still, and when I told
myself that if in actual fact he had spoken my name it was perhaps
only to himself (as I was speaking his) my heart throbbed up to my
throat.</p>
<p>Once more I heard his voice.</p>
<p>"Mary!"</p>
<p>I could bear no more. Martin wanted me. I must go to him. Though
body and soul were torn asunder I must go.</p>
<p>Before I knew what I was doing I had opened the door and was
walking across the corridor in the direction of Martin's room.</p>
<p>The house was dark. Everybody had gone to bed. Light as my
footsteps were, the landing was creaking under me. I knew that the
floors of the grim old Castle sometimes made noises when nobody
walked on them, but none the less I felt afraid.</p>
<p>Half way to Martin's door I stopped. A ghostly hand seemed to be
laid on my shoulder and a ghostly voice seemed to say in my
ear:</p>
<p>"Wait! Reflect! If you do what you are thinking of doing what
will happen? You will become an outcast. The whole body of your own
sex will turn against you. You will be a bad woman."</p>
<p>I knew what it was. It was my conscience speaking to me in the
voice of my Church&mdash;my Church, the mighty, irresistible power
that was separating me from Martin. I was its child, born in its
bosom, but if I broke its laws it would roll over me like a
relentless Juggernaut.</p>
<p>It was not at first that I could understand why the Church
should set itself up against my Womanhood. My Womanhood was crying
out for life and love and liberty. But the Church, in its
inexorable, relentless voice, was saying, "Thou Shalt Not!"</p>
<p>After a moment of impenetrable darkness, within and without, I
thought I saw things more plainly. The Church was the soul of the
world. It stood for purity, which alone could hold the human family
together. If all women who had made unhappy marriages were to do as
I was thinking of doing (no matter under what temptation) the world
would fall to wreck and ruin.</p>
<p>Feeling crushed and ashamed, and oh, so little and weak, I
groped my way back to the boudoir and closed the door.</p>
<p>Then a strange thing happened&mdash;one of those little
accidents of life which seem to be thrown off by the mighty hand of
Fate. A shaft of light from my bedroom, crossing the end of my
writing-desk, showed me a copy of a little insular newspaper.</p>
<p>The paper, which must have come by the evening post, had
probably been opened by Martin, and for that reason only I took it
up and glanced at it.</p>
<p>The first thing that caught my eye was a short report headed
"Charity Performance."</p>
<p>It ran:</p>
<p>"<i>The English ladies and gentlemen from Castle Raa who are
cruising round the island in the handsome steam yacht, the</i>
Cleopatra, <i>gave a variety entertainment last night in aid of the
Catholic Mission at the Palace, Ravenstown</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>At the end of the performance the Lord Bishop, who was
present in person and watched every item of the programme with
obvious enjoyment, proposed a vote of thanks in his usual
felicitous terms, thanking Lord Raa for this further proof of his
great liberality of mind in helping a Catholic charity, and
particularly mentioning the beautiful and accomplished Madame Lier,
who had charmed all eyes and won all hearts by her serpentine
dances, and to whom the Church in Ellan would always be indebted
for the handsome sum which had been the result of her disinterested
efforts in promoting the entertainment</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>It is understood that the</i> Cleopatra <i>will leave
Ravenstown Harbour to-morrow morning on her way back to Port
Raa</i>."</p>
<p>That was the end of everything. It came upon me like a torrent
and swept all my scruples away.</p>
<p>Such was the purity of the Church&mdash;threatening <i>me</i>
with its censures for wishing to follow the purest dictates of my
heart, yet taking money from a woman like Alma, who was bribing it
to be blind to her misconduct and to cover her with its
good-will!</p>
<p>My husband too&mdash;his infidelities were flagrant and
notorious, yet the Church, through its minister, was flattering his
vanity and condoning his offences!</p>
<p>He was coming back to me, too&mdash;this adulterous husband, and
when he came the Church would require that I should keep "true
faith" with him, whatever his conduct, and deny myself the pure
love that was now awake within me.</p>
<p>But no, no, no! Never again! It would be a living death.
Accursed be the power that could doom a woman to a living
death!</p>
<p>Perhaps I was no longer sane&mdash;morally sane&mdash;and if so
God and the Church will forgive me. But seeing that neither the
Church nor the Law could liberate me from this bond which I did not
make, that both were shielding the evil man and tolerating the bad
woman, my whole soul rose in revolt.</p>
<p>I told myself now that to leave my husband and go to Martin
would be to escape from shame to honour.</p>
<p>I saw Martin's despairing face again as I had seen it at the
moment of our parting, and my brain rang with his passionate words.
"You are my wife. I am your real husband. We love each other. We
shall continue to love each other. No matter where you are, or what
they do with you, you are mine and always will be."</p>
<p>Something was crying out within me: "Love him! Tell him you love
him. Now, now! He is going away. To-morrow will be too late. Go to
him. This will be your true marriage. The other was only legalised
and sanctified prostitution."</p>
<p>I leapt up, and tearing the door open, I walked with strong
steps across the corridor towards Martin's room.</p>
<p>My hair was down, my arms were bare in the ample sleeves of my
dressing-gown, and my breast was as open as it had been on the
balcony, but I thought nothing of all that.</p>
<p>I did not knock at Martin's door. I took hold of the handle as
one who had a right. It turned of itself and the door opened.</p>
<p>My mind was in a whirl, black rings were circling round my eyes,
but I heard my trembling, quivering, throbbing voice, as if it had
been the voice of somebody else, saying:</p>
<p>"Martin, I am coming in."</p>
<p>Then my heart which had been beating violently seemed to stop.
My limbs gave way. I was about to fall.</p>
<p>At the next moment strong arms were around me. I had no fear.
But there was a roaring in my brain such as the ice makes when it
is breaking up.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>Oh, you good women, who are happy in the love that guards you,
shields you, shelters you, wraps you round and keeps you pure and
true, tread lightly over the prostrate soul of your sister in her
hour of trial and fierce temptation.</p>
<p>And you blessed and holy saints who kneel before the Mother of
all Mothers, take the transgression of her guilty child to Him
who&mdash;long ago in the house of the self-righteous
Pharisee&mdash;said to the woman who was a sinner and yet loved
much&mdash;the woman who had washed His feet with her tears and
dried them with the hair of her head&mdash;"Thy sins are forgiven
thee."</p>

"SEVENTIETH_CHAPTER"></a>SEVENTIETH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Next morning, at half-past eight, my Martin left me.</p>
<p>We were standing together in the boudoir between the table and
the fire, which was burning briskly, for the sultry weather had
gone in the night, and the autumn air was keen, though the early
sun was shining.</p>
<p>At the last moment he was unwilling to go, and it was as much as
I could do to persuade him. Perhaps it is one of the mysteries
which God alone can read that our positions seemed to have been
reversed since the day before.</p>
<p>He was confused, agitated, and full of self reproaches, while I
felt no fear and no remorse, but only an indescribable joy, as if a
new and gracious life had suddenly dawned on me.</p>
<p>"I don't feel that I can leave England now," he said.</p>
<p>"You can and you must," I answered, and then I spoke of his
expedition as a great work which it was impossible to put off.</p>
<p>"Somebody else must do it, then," he said.</p>
<p>"Nobody else can, or shall," I replied.</p>
<p>"But our lives are for ever joined together now, and everything
else must go by the board."</p>
<p>"Nothing shall go by the board for my sake, Martin. I refuse and
forbid it."</p>
<p>Everything had been arranged, everything settled, great sums of
money had been subscribed out of faith in him, and him only, and a
large company was ready and waiting to sail under his command. He
was the Man of Destiny, therefore nothing&mdash;nothing
whatever&mdash;must keep him back.</p>
<p>"Then if I must go, you must go too," he said. "I mean you must
go with me to London and wait there until I return."</p>
<p>"That is impossible," I answered.</p>
<p>The eyes of the world were on him now, and the heart of the
world was with him. If I did what he desired it would reflect
dishonour on his name, and he should not suffer for my sake under
any circumstances.</p>
<p>"But think what may happen to you while I am away," he said.</p>
<p>"Nothing will happen while you are away, Martin."</p>
<p>"But how can you be so sure of the future when God alone knows
what it is to be?"</p>
<p>"Then God will provide for it," I said, and with that last
answer he had to be satisfied.</p>
<p>"You must take a letter from me at all events," said Martin, and
sitting at my desk he began to write one.</p>
<p>It is amazing to me now when I come to think of it that I could
have been so confident of myself and so indifferent to
consequences. But I was thinking of one thing only&mdash;that
Martin must go on his great errand, finish his great work and win
his great reward, without making any sacrifice for me.</p>
<p>After a few minutes he rose from the desk and handed me his
letter.</p>
<p>"Here it is," he said. "If the worst comes to the worst you may
find it of some use some day."</p>
<p>I took it and doubled it and continued to hold it in my
hand.</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to look at it!" he said.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Not even to see whom it is written to?"</p>
<p>"That is unnecessary."</p>
<p>I thought I knew it was written to my husband or my father, and
it did not matter to me which, for I had determined not to use
it.</p>
<p>"It is open&mdash;won't you see what it says?"</p>
<p>"That is unnecessary also."</p>
<p>I thought I knew that Martin had tried to take everything upon
himself, and I was resolved that he should not do so.</p>
<p>He looked at me with that worshipful expression which seen in
the eyes of the man who loves her, makes a woman proud to be
alive.</p>
<p>"I feel as if I want to kiss the hem of your dress, Mary," he
said, and after that there was a moment of heavenly silence.</p>
<p>It was now half-past eight&mdash;the hour when the motor-car had
been ordered round to take him to the town&mdash;and though I felt
as if I could shed drops of my blood to keep back the finger of my
cuckoo clock I pointed it out and said it was time for him to
go.</p>
<p>I think our parting was the most beautiful moment of all my
life.</p>
<p>We were standing a little apart, for though I wanted to throw my
arms about his neck at that last instant I would not allow myself
to do so, because I knew that that would make it the harder for him
to go.</p>
<p>I could see, too, that he was trying not to make it harder for
me, so we stood in silence for a moment while my bosom heaved and
his breath came quick.</p>
<p>Then he took my right hand in both of his hands and said: "There
is a bond between us now which can never be broken."</p>
<p>"Never," I answered.</p>
<p>"Whatever happens to either of us we belong to each other for
ever."</p>
<p>"For ever and ever," I replied.</p>
<p>I felt his hands tighten at that, and after another moment of
silence, he said:</p>
<p>"I may be a long time away, Mary."</p>
<p>"I can wait."</p>
<p>"Down there a man has to meet many dangers."</p>
<p>"You will come back. Providence will take care of you."</p>
<p>"I think it will. I feel I shall. But if I don't. . . ."</p>
<p>I knew what he was trying to say. A shadow seemed to pass
between us. My throat grew thick, and for a moment I could not
speak. But then I heard myself say:</p>
<p>"Love is stronger than death; many waters cannot quench it."</p>
<p>His hands quivered, his whole body trembled, and I thought he
was going to clasp me to his breast as before, but he only drew
down my forehead with his hot hand and kissed it.</p>
<p>That was all, but a blinding mist seemed to pass before my eyes,
and when it cleared the door of the room was open and my Martin was
gone.</p>
<p>I stood where he had left me and listened.</p>
<p>I heard his strong step on the stone flags of the hall&mdash;he
was going out at the porch.</p>
<p>I heard the metallic clashing of the door of the
automobile&mdash;he was already in the car.</p>
<p>I heard the throb of the motor and ruckling of the gravel of the
path&mdash;he was moving away.</p>
<p>I heard the dying down of the engine and the soft roll of the
rubber wheels&mdash;I was alone.</p>
<p>For some moments after that the world seemed empty and void. But
the feeling passed, and when I recovered my strength I found
Martin's letter in my moist left hand.</p>
<p>Then I knelt before the fire, and putting the letter into the
flames I burnt it.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SEVENTY_FIRST_CHAPTER" id=
"SEVENTY_FIRST_CHAPTER"></a>SEVENTY-FIRST CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Within, two hours of Martin's departure I had regained complete
possession of myself and was feeling more happy than I had ever
felt before.</p>
<p>The tormenting compunctions of the past months were gone. It was
just as if I had obeyed some higher law of my being and had become
a freer and purer woman.</p>
<p>My heart leapt within me and to give free rein to the riot of my
joy I put on my hat and cloak to go into the glen.</p>
<p>Crossing the garden I came upon Tommy the Mate, who told me
there had been a terrific thunderstorm during the night, with
torrential rain, which had torn up all the foreign plants in his
flower-beds.</p>
<p>"It will do good, though," said the old man. "Clane out some of
their dirty ould drains, I'm thinkin'."</p>
<p>Then he spoke of Martin, whom he had seen off, saying he would
surely come back.</p>
<p>"'Deed he will though. A boy like yander wasn't born to lave his
bark in the ice and snow . . . Not if his anchor's at home,
anyway"&mdash;with a "glime" in my direction.</p>
<p>How the glen sang to me that morning! The great cathedral of
nature seemed to ring with music&mdash;the rustling of the leaves
overhead, the ticking of the insects underfoot, the bleating of the
sheep, the lowing of the cattle, the light chanting of the stream,
the deep organ-song of the sea, and then the swelling and soaring
Gloria in my own bosom, which shot up out of my heart like a lark
out of the grass in the morning.</p>
<p>I wanted to run, I wanted to shout, and when I came to the paths
where Martin and I had walked together I wanted&mdash;silly as it
sounds to say so&mdash;to go down on my knees and kiss the very
turf which his feet had trod.</p>
<p>I took lunch in the boudoir as before, but I did not feel as if
I were alone, for I had only to close my eyes and Martin, from the
other side of the table, seemed to be looking across at me. And
neither did I feel that the room was full of dead laughter, for our
living voices seemed to be ringing in it still.</p>
<p>After tea I read again my only love-letter, revelling in the
dear delightful errors in spelling which made it Martin's and
nobody else's, and then I observed for the first time what was said
about "the boys of Blackwater," and their intention of "getting up
a spree."</p>
<p>This suggested that perhaps Martin had not yet left the island
but was remaining for the evening steamer, in order to be present
at some sort of celebrations to be given in his honour.</p>
<p>So at seven o'clock&mdash;it was dark by that time&mdash;I was
down at the Quay, sitting in our covered automobile, which had been
drawn up in a sheltered and hidden part of the pier, almost
opposite the outgoing steamer.</p>
<p>Shall I ever forget the scene that followed?</p>
<p>First, came a band of music playing one of our native songs,
which was about a lamb that had been lost in the snow, and how the
Big Man of the Farm went out in search of it, and found it and
brought it home in his arms.</p>
<p>Then came a double row of young men carrying flags and
banners&mdash;fine, clean-limbed lads such as make a woman's heart
leap to look at them.</p>
<p>Then came Martin in a jaunting car with a cheering crowd
alongside of him, trying to look cheerful but finding it fearfully
hard to do so.</p>
<p>And then&mdash;and this touched me most of all&mdash;a double
line of girls in knitted woollen caps (such as men wear in frozen
regions) over their heads and down the sides of their comely
faces.</p>
<p>I was crying like a child at the sight of it all, but none the
less I was supremely happy.</p>
<p>When the procession reached the gangway Martin disappeared into
the steamer, and then the bandsmen ranged themselves in front of
it, and struck up another song:</p>
<p>"<i>Come back to Erin, mavourneen, mavourneen,<br />
Come back, aroon, to the land of your birth</i>."</p>
<p>In another moment every voice in the crowd seemed to take up the
refrain.</p>
<p>That brought Martin on to the captain's bridge, where he stood
bareheaded, struggling to smile.</p>
<p>By this time the last of the ship's bells had rung, the funnels
were belching, and the captain's voice was calling on the piermen
to clear away.</p>
<p>At last the hawsers were thrown off and the steamer started,
but, with Martin still standing bareheaded on the bridge, the
people rushed to the end of the pier to see the last of him.</p>
<p>There they sang again, louder than ever, the girls' clear voices
above all the rest, as the ship sailed out into the dark sea.</p>
<p><i>"Come back to Erin, mavourneen, mavourneen,<br />
Come back, aroon, to the land of your birth."</i></p>
<p>As well as I could, for the mist in my eyes was blinding me, I
watched the steamer until she slid behind the headland of the bay,
round, the revolving light that stands on the point of
it&mdash;stretching my neck through the window of the car, while
the fresh wind from the sea smote my hot face and the salt air
licked my parched lips. And then I fell back in my seat and cried
for sheer joy of the love that was shown to Martin.</p>
<p>The crowd was returning down the pier by this time, like a black
river running in the darkness and rumbling over rugged stones, and
I heard their voices as they passed the car.</p>
<p>One voice&mdash;a female voice&mdash;said:</p>
<p>"Well, what do you think of <i>our</i> Martin Conrad?"</p>
<p>And then another voice&mdash;a male voice&mdash;answered:</p>
<p>"By God he's a Man!"</p>
<p>Within a few minutes the pier was deserted, and the chauffeur
was saying:</p>
<p>"Home, my lady?"</p>
<p>"Home," I answered.</p>
<p>Seeing Martin off had been too much like watching the lifeboat
on a dark and stormy night, when the lights dip behind a monstrous
wave and for some breathless moments you fear they will never
rise.</p>
<p>But as we drove up the head I caught the lights of the steamer
again now far out at sea, and well I knew that as surely as my
Martin was there he was thinking of me and looking back towards the
house in which he had left me behind him.</p>
<p>When we reached the Castle I found to my surprise that every
window was ablaze.</p>
<p>The thrum of the automobile brought Price into the hall. She
told me that the yachting party had come back, and were now in
their bedrooms dressing for dinner.</p>
<p>As I went upstairs to my own apartments I heard trills of
laughter from behind several of the closed doors, mingled with the
muffled humming of various music-hall ditties.</p>
<p>And then suddenly a new spirit seemed to take possession of me,
and I knew that I had become another woman.</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM BY MARTIN CONRAD</p>
<p>My darling was right. For a long hour after leaving Blackwater I
continued to stand on the captain's bridge, looking back at the
lighted windows of the house above Port Raa, and asking myself the
question which for sixteen months thereafter was to haunt me day
and night&mdash;Why had I left her behind me?</p>
<p>In spite of all her importunities, all her sweet unselfish
thought of my own aims and interests, all her confidence in
herself, all her brave determination to share responsibility for
whatever the future might have in store for us&mdash;Why had I left
her behind me?</p>
<p>The woman God gave me was mine&mdash;why had I left her in the
house of a man who, notwithstanding his infidelities and
brutalities, had a right in the eyes of the law, the church, and
the world to call her his wife and to treat her accordingly?</p>
<p>Let me make no pretence of a penitence I did not feel. Never for
one moment did I reproach myself for what had happened. Never for
the shadow of a moment did I reproach her. She had given herself to
me of her queenly right and sovereign grace as every good woman in
the world must give herself to the man she loves if their union is
to be pure and true.</p>
<p>But why did I not see then, as I see now, that it is the law of
Nature&mdash;the cruel and at the same time the glorious law of
Nature&mdash;that the woman shall bear the burden, the woman shall
pay the price?</p>
<p>It is over now, and though many a time since my sweet girl has
said out of her stainless heart that everything has worked out for
the best, and suffering is God's salt for keeping our souls alive,
when I think of what she went through for me, while I was out of
all reach and sight, I know I shall never forgive myself for
leaving her behind&mdash;never, never never.</p>

<h2><a name="SEVENTY_SECOND_CHAPTER" id=
"SEVENTY_SECOND_CHAPTER"></a>SEVENTY-SECOND CHAPTER</h2>
<p>As this will be the last time I shall have to speak of my
husband's guests, I wish to repeat that I am trying to describe
them without malice exactly as they were&mdash;selfish, cruel,
ill-mannered, and insincere.</p>
<p>The dinner-bell rang while I was dressing, and on going
downstairs a few minutes afterwards I found that there had been no
attempt to wait for me.</p>
<p>Already the whole party were assembled at the table, my husband
being at the foot of it, and Alma (incredible as it may seem) in
the place of the hostess at the head.</p>
<p>This in my altered mood, was more than I could bear, so, while
the company made some attempt to welcome me with rather crude
salutations, and old Mrs. Lier cried, "Come along here, my pore
dear, and tell me how you've gotten on while we've been away"
(indicating an empty seat by her side), I walked boldly up to Alma,
put my hand on the back of her chair and said, "If you please."</p>
<p>Alma looked surprised. But after a moment she carried off the
difficult situation by taking the seat which had been reserved for
me beside her mother, by congratulating me on my improved
appearance and herself on relief from the necessity of filling my
place and discharging my responsible duties.</p>
<p>My husband, with the rest of the company, had looked up at the
awkward incident, and I thought I saw by his curious grimace that
he supposed my father (of whom he was always in fear) had told me
to assert myself. But Alma, with surer instinct, was clearly
thinking of Martin, and almost immediately she began to speak of
him.</p>
<p>"So your great friend has just gone, dearest. The servants are
crazy about him. We've missed him again, you see. Too bad! I hope
you gave him our regrets and excuses&mdash;did you?"</p>
<p>The evil one must have taken hold of me by this time, for I
said:</p>
<p>"I certainly did not, Alma."</p>
<p>"Why not, my love?"</p>
<p>"Because we have a saying in our island that it's only the ass
that eats the cushag"&mdash;a bitter weed that grows in barren
places.</p>
<p>Alma joined in the general laughter which followed this rather
intemperate reply, and then led off the conversation On the
incidents of the cruise.</p>
<p>I gathered that, encouraged by her success in capturing the
Bishop by her entertainment, she had set herself to capture the
"aristocracy" of our island by inviting them to a dance on the
yacht, while it lay at anchor off Holmtown, and the humour of the
moment was to play battledore and shuttlecock with the grotesque
efforts of our great people (the same that had figured at my
wedding) to grovel before my husband and his guests.</p>
<p>"I say, Jimmy," cried Mr. Vivian in his shrill treble, "do you
remember the old gal in the gauze who&mdash;etc . . . ?"</p>
<p>"But do you remember," cried Mr. Eastcliff, "the High Bailiff or
Bum Bailiff with the bottle-nose who&mdash;etc . . . ?"</p>
<p>"Killing, wasn't it, Vivian?" said one of the ladies.</p>
<p>"Perfectly killing," said everybody.</p>
<p>This shocking exhibition of bad manners had not gone on very
long before I became aware that it was being improvised for my
benefit.</p>
<p>After Alma had admitted that the Bishop was a "great flirt" of
hers, and Mr. Vivian, amid shouts of laughter, had christened him
her "crush," she turned to me and said, with her smiling face
slightly drawn down on one side:</p>
<p>"Mary, my love, you will certainly agree that your islanders who
do not eat cushags, poor dears, are the funniest people alive as
guests."</p>
<p>"Not funnier," I answered, "than the people who laugh at them as
hosts."</p>
<p>It was not easy to laugh at that, so to cover Alma's confusion
the men turned the talk to their usual topic, horses and dogs, and
I heard a great deal about "laying on the hounds," which culminated
in a rather vulgar story of how a beater who "wasn't nippy on his
pins" had been "peppered from behind," whereupon he had "bellowed
like a bull" until "soothed down by a sov."</p>
<p>I cannot say how long the talk would have continued in this
manner if old Mrs. Lier, addressing herself to me, had not struck a
serious subject.</p>
<p>It was about Alma's dog, which was dead. The poor wheezy,
spaniel had died in the course of the cruise, though what the cause
of its death was nobody knew, unless it had been fretting for its
mistress during the period of quarantine which the absurd
regulations of government had required on our return from
abroad.</p>
<p>The dog having died at sea, I presumed it had been buried there,
but no, that seemed to shock the company as an unfeeling
supposition. The ship's carpenter had made a coffin for it&mdash;a
beautiful one of mahogany with a plate-glass inset at the head, and
a gilt-lettered inscription below, giving the dog's name, Prue, and
its age, three.</p>
<p>In this condition it had been brought ashore, and was now lying
in a kind of state in Alma's dressing-room. But to-morrow it was to
be buried in the grounds, probably in the glen, to which the
company, all dressed in black, were to follow in procession as at a
human funeral.</p>
<p>I was choking with anger and horror at the recital of these
incredible arrangements, and at the close of it I said in a clear,
emphatic voice:</p>
<p>"I must ask you to be good enough not to do that, please."</p>
<p>"Why not, my dear?" said Alma.</p>
<p>"Because I do not wish and cannot permit it," I answered.</p>
<p>There was an awkward pause after this unexpected pronouncement,
and when the conversation was resumed my quick ears (which have not
always added to my happiness) caught the half-smothered words:</p>
<p>"Getting a bit sidey, isn't she?"</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when I rose to leave the dining-room, Alma wound
her arm round my waist, called me her "dear little nun," and
carried me off to the hall.</p>
<p>There we sat about the big open fire, and after a while the talk
became as free, as it often is among fashionable ladies of a
certain class.</p>
<p>Mr. Eastcliff's Camilla told a slightly indelicate anecdote of a
"dresser" she had had at the theatre, and then another young woman
(the same who "adored the men who went to the deuce for a woman")
repeated the terms of an advertisement she had seen in a Church
newspaper: "A parlour-maid wants a situation in a family where a
footman is kept."</p>
<p>The laughter which followed this story was loud enough, but it
was redoubled when Alma's mother, from the depths of an arm-chair,
said, with her usual solemnity, that she "didn't see nothing to
laugh at" in that, and "the pore girl hadn't no such thought as
they had."</p>
<p>Again I was choking with indignation, and in order to assert
myself once for all I said:</p>
<p>"Ladies, I will ask you to discontinue this kind of
conversation. I don't like it."</p>
<p>At last the climax came.</p>
<p>About ten days after Martin left me I received a telegram, which
had been put ashore at Southampton, saying, "Good-bye! God bless
you!" and next day there came a newspaper containing an account of
his last night at Tilbury.</p>
<p>He had given a dinner to a number of his friends, including his
old commander and his wife, several other explorers who happened to
be in London, a Cabinet Minister, and the proprietor of the journal
which had promoted his expedition.</p>
<p>They had dined in the saloon of the "Scotia" (how vividly I
remembered it!), finishing up the evening with a dance on deck in
the moonlight; and when the time came to break up, Martin had made
one of his sentimental little speeches (all heart and not too much
grammar), in which he said that in starting out for another siege
of the South Pole he "couldn't help thinking, with a bit of a pain
under the third button of his double-breasted waistcoat, of the
dear ones they were leaving behind, and of the unknown regions
whither they were tending where dancing would be forgotten."</p>
<p>I need not say how this moved me, being where I was, in that
uncongenial company; but by some mischance I left the paper which
contained it on the table in the drawing-room, and on going
downstairs after breakfast next morning I found Alma stretched out
in a rocking-chair before the fire in the hail, smoking a cigarette
and reading the report aloud in a mock heroic tone to a number of
the men, including my husband, whose fat body (he was growing
corpulent) was shaking with laughter.</p>
<p>It was as much as I could do to control an impulse to jump down
and flare out at them, but, being lightly shod, I was standing
quietly in their midst before they were aware of my presence.</p>
<p>"Ah," said Alma, with the sweetest and most insincere of her
smiles, "we were just enjoying the beautiful account of your
friend's last night in England."</p>
<p>"So I see," I said, and, boiling with anger underneath, I
quietly took the paper out of her hand between the tips of my thumb
and first finger (as if the contamination of her touch had made it
unclean) and carried it to the fire and burnt it.</p>
<p>This seemed to be the end of all things. The tall Mr. Eastcliff
went over to the open door and said:</p>
<p>"Deuced fine day for a motor drive, isn't it?"</p>
<p>That gentleman had hitherto shown no alacrity in establishing
the truth of Alma's excuse for the cruise on the ground of his
visit to "his friend who had taken a shoot in Skye;" but now he
found himself too deeply interested in the Inverness Meeting to
remain longer, while the rest of the party became so absorbed in
the Perth and Ayr races, salmon-fishing on the Tay, and
stag-shooting in the deer-forests of Invercauld, that within a week
thereafter I had said good-bye to all of them.</p>
<p>All save Alma.</p>
<p>I was returning from the hall after the departure of a group of
my guests when Alma followed me to my room and said:</p>
<p>"My dear, sweet girl, I want you to do me the greatest
kindness."</p>
<p>She had to take her mother to New York shortly; but as "that
dear old dunce" was the worst of all possible sailors, it would be
necessary to wait for the largest of all possible steamers, and as
the largest steamers sailed from Liverpool, and Ellan was so near
to that port, perhaps I would not mind . . . just for a week or two
longer. . . .</p>
<p>What <i>could</i> I say? What I did say was what I had said
before, with equal weakness and indiscretion, but less than equal
danger. A word, half a word, and almost before it was spoken,
Alma's arms were about my neck and she was calling me her "dearest,
sweetest, kindest friend in the world."</p>
<p>My maid Price was present at this interview, and hardly had Alma
left the boudoir when she was twitching at my arm and whispering in
my ear:</p>
<p>"My lady, my lady, don't you see what the woman wants? She's
watching you."</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SEVENTY_THIRD_CHAPTER" id=
"SEVENTY_THIRD_CHAPTER"></a>SEVENTY-THIRD CHAPTER</h2>
<p>My husband was the next to go.</p>
<p>He made excuse of his Parliamentary duties. He might be three or
four weeks away, but meantime Alma would be with me, and in any
case I was not the sort of person to feel lonely.</p>
<p>Never having heard before of any devotion to his duty as a peer,
I asked if that was all that was taking him to London.</p>
<p>"Perhaps not all," he answered, and then, with a twang of voice
and a twitch of feature, he said:</p>
<p>"I'm getting sick of this God-forsaken place, and then . . . to
tell you the truth, your own behaviour is beginning to raw me."</p>
<p>With my husband's departure my triumphal course seemed to come
to a close. Left alone with Alma, I became as weak and irresolute
as before and began to brood upon Price's warning.</p>
<p>My maid had found a fierce delight in my efforts to assert
myself as mistress in my husband's house, but now (taking her
former advantage) she was for ever harping upon my foolishness in
allowing Alma to remain in it.</p>
<p>"She's deceiving you, my lady," said Price. "<i>Her</i> waiting
for a steamer indeed! Not a bit of her. If your ladyship will not
fly out at me again and pack me off bag and baggage, I'll tell you
what's she's waiting for."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"She's waiting for . . . she thinks . . . she fancies . . .
well, to tell you the honest truth, my lady, the bad-minded thing
suspects that something is going to happen to your ladyship, and
she's just waiting for the chance of telling his lordship."</p>
<p>I began to feel ill. A dim, vague, uneasy presentiment of coming
trouble took frequent possession of my mind.</p>
<p>I tried to suppress it. I struggled to strangle it as an ugly
monster created by the nervous strain I had been going through, and
for a time I succeeded in doing so. I had told Martin that nothing
would happen during his absence, and I compelled myself to believe
that nothing would or could.</p>
<p>Weeks passed; the weather changed; the golden hue of autumn gave
place to a chilly greyness; the sky became sad with winterly
clouds; the land became soggy with frequent rains; the trees showed
their bare black boughs; the withered leaves drifted along the
roads before blustering winds that came up from the sea; the
evenings grew long and the mornings dreary; but still Alma, with
her mother, remained at Castle Raa.</p>
<p>I began to be afraid of her. Something of the half-hypnotic
spell which she had exercised over me when I was a child asserted
itself again, but now it seemed to me to be always evil and
sometimes almost demoniacal.</p>
<p>I had a feeling that she was watching me day and night.
Occasionally, when she thought I was looking down, I caught the
vivid gaze of her coal-black eyes looking across at me through her
long sable-coloured eyelashes.</p>
<p>Her conversation was as sweet and suave as ever, but I found
myself creeping away from her and even shrinking from her
touch.</p>
<p>More than once I remembered what Martin in his blunt way had
said of her: "I hate that woman; she's like a snake; I want to put
my foot on it."</p>
<p>The feeling that I was alone in this great gaunt house with a
woman who was waiting and watching to do me a mischief, that she
might step into my shoes, was preying upon my health and
spirits.</p>
<p>Sometimes I had sensations of faintness and exhaustion for which
I could not account. Looking into my glass in the morning, I saw
that my nose was becoming pinched, my cheeks thin, and my whole
face not merely pale, but grey.</p>
<p>Alma saw these changes in my appearance, and in the over-sweet
tones of her succulent voice she constantly offered me her
sympathy. I always declined it, protesting that I was perfectly
well, but none the less I shrank within myself and became more and
more unhappy.</p>
<p>So fierce a strain could not last very long, and the climax came
about three weeks after my husband had left for London.</p>
<p>I was rising from breakfast with Alma and her mother when I was
suddenly seized with giddiness, and, after staggering for a moment,
I fainted right away.</p>
<p>On recovering consciousness I found myself stretched out on the
floor with Alma and her mother leaning over me.</p>
<p>Never to the last hour of my life shall I forget the look in
Alma's eyes as I opened my own. With her upper lip sucked in and
her lower one slightly set forward she was giving her mother a
quick side-glance of evil triumph.</p>
<p>I was overwhelmed with confusion. I thought I might have been
speaking as I was coming to, mentioning a name perhaps, out of that
dim and sacred chamber of the unconscious soul into which God alone
should see. I noticed, too, that my bodice had been unhooked at the
back so as to leave it loose over my bosom.</p>
<p>As soon as Alma saw that my eyes were open, she put her arm
under my head and began to pour out a flood of honeyed words into
my ears.</p>
<p>"My dear, sweet darling," she said, "you scared us to death. We
must send for a doctor immediately&mdash;your own doctor, you
know."</p>
<p>I tried to say there was no necessity, but she would not
listen.</p>
<p>"Such a seizure may be of no consequence, my love. I trust it
isn't. But on the other hand, it may be a serious matter, and it is
my duty, dearest, my duty to your husband, to discover the cause of
it."</p>
<p>I knew quite well what Alma was thinking of, yet I could not say
more without strengthening her suspicions, so I asked for Price,
who helped me up to my room, where I sat on the edge of the bed
while she gave me brandy and other restoratives.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of the end. I needed no doctor to say
what had befallen me. It was something more stupendous for me than
the removal of mountains or the stopping of the everlasting coming
and going of the sea.</p>
<p>The greatest of the mysteries of womanhood, the most sacred, the
most divine, the mighty mystery of a new life had come to me as it
comes to other women. Yet how had it come? Like a lowering
thunderstorm.</p>
<p>That golden hour of her sex, which ought to be the sweetest and
most joyful in a woman's life&mdash;the hour when she goes with a
proud and swelling heart to the one she loves, the one who loves
her, and with her arms about his neck and her face hidden in his
breast whispers her great new secret, and he clasps her more fondly
than ever to his heart, because another and closer union has bound
them together&mdash;that golden hour had come to me, and there was
none to share it.</p>
<p>O God! O God! How proudly I had been holding up my head! How I
had been trampling on the conventions of morality, the canons of
law, and even the sacraments of religion, thinking Nature, which
had made our hearts what they are, did not mean a woman to be
ashamed of her purest instincts!</p>
<p>And now Nature herself had risen up to condemn me, and before
long the whole world would be joining in her cry.</p>
<p>If Martin had been there at that moment I do not think I should
have cared what people might think or say of a woman in my
condition. But he was separated from me by this time by thousands
of miles of sea, and was going deeper and deeper every day into the
dark Antarctic night.</p>
<p>How weak I felt, how little, how helpless! Never for a moment
did I blame Martin. But I was alone with my responsibility, I was
still living in my husband's house, and&mdash;worst of
all&mdash;another woman knew my secret.</p>

<h2><a name="SEVENTY_FOURTH_CHAPTER" id=
"SEVENTY_FOURTH_CHAPTER"></a>SEVENTY-FOURTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Early next day Doctor Conrad came to see me. I thought it
significant that he came in my father's big motor-car&mdash;a car
of great speed and power.</p>
<p>I was in my dressing-gown before the fire in the boudoir, and at
the first glance of his cheerful face under his iron-grey head I
knew what Alma had said in the letter which had summoned him.</p>
<p>In his soft voice he asked me a few questions, and though I
could have wished to conceal the truth I dared not. I noticed that
his face brightened at each of my replies, and at the end of them
he said:</p>
<p>"There is nothing to be alarmed at. We shall be better than ever
by-and-by."</p>
<p>Then in his sweet and delicate way (as if he were saying
something that would be very grateful) he told me what I knew
already, and I listened with my head down and my face towards the
fire.</p>
<p>He must have been disappointed at the sad way I received his
news, for he proceeded to talk of my general health; saying the
great thing in such a case as mine was to be cheerful, to keep a
good heart, and to look hopefully to the future.</p>
<p>"You must have pleasant surroundings and the society of
agreeable people&mdash;old friends, old schoolfellows, familiar and
happy faces."</p>
<p>I said "Yes" and "Yes," knowing only too well how impossible it
all was; and then his talk turned on general topics&mdash;my
father, whose condition made his face very grave, and then his
wife, Christian Ann, whose name caused his gentle old eyes to gleam
with sunshine.</p>
<p>She had charged him with a message to me.</p>
<p>"Tell her," she had said, "I shall never forget what she did for
me in the autumn, and whiles and whiles I'm thanking God for
her."</p>
<p>That cut me to the quick, but I was nearly torn to pieces by
what came next.</p>
<p>"Christian Ann told me to say too that Sunny Lodge is longing
for you. 'She's a great lady now,' said she, 'but maybe great
ladies have their troubles same as ourselves, poor things, and if
she ever wants to rest her sweet head in a poor woman's bed, Mary
O'Neill's little room is always waiting for her.'"</p>
<p>"God bless her!" I said&mdash;it was all I <i>could</i>
say&mdash;and then, to my great relief, he talked on other
subjects.</p>
<p>The one thing I was afraid of was that he might speak of Martin.
Heaven alone, which looks into the deep places of a woman's heart
in her hour of sorest trial, knows why I was in such dread that he
might do so, but sure I am that if he had mentioned Martin at that
moment I should have screamed.</p>
<p>When he rose to go he repeated his warnings.</p>
<p>"You'll remember what I said about being bright and
cheerful?"</p>
<p>"I'll try."</p>
<p>"And keeping happy and agreeable faces about you?"</p>
<p>"Ye-s."</p>
<p>Hardly had he left the room when Alma came sweeping into it,
full of I her warmest and insincerest congratulations.</p>
<p>"There!" she cried, with all the bitter honey of her tongue.
"Wasn't I right in sending for the doctor? Such news, too! Oh,
happy, happy you! But I must not keep you now, dearest. You'll be
just crazy to write to your husband and tell him all about it."</p>
<p>Alma's mother was the next to visit me. The comfortable old
soul, redolent of perfume and glittering with diamonds, began by
congratulating herself on her perspicacity.</p>
<p>"I knew it," she said. "When I saw as how you were so and so, I
said to Alma as I was sure you were that way. 'Impossible,' said
Alma, but it's us married women to know, isn't it?"</p>
<p>After that, and some homely counsel out of her own
experience&mdash;to take my breakfast in bed in future, avoiding
tea, &amp;c.,&mdash;she told me how fortunate I was to have Alma in
the house at such a moment.</p>
<p>"The doctor says you're to be kept bright and cheerful, and
she's such a happy heart, is Alma. So crazy about you too! You
wouldn't believe it, but she's actually talking of staying with you
until the December sailing, at all events."</p>
<p>The prospect of having Alma two months longer, to probe my
secret soul as with a red-hot iron, seemed enough to destroy me,
but my martyrdom had only begun.</p>
<p>Next day, Aunt Bridget came, and the bright glitter of the
usually cold grey eyes behind her gold-rimmed spectacles told me at
a glance that her visit was not an unselfish one.</p>
<p>"There now," she said, "you've got to thank me for this. Didn't
I give you good advice when I told you to be a little blind? It's
the only way with husbands. When Conrad came home with the news I
said, 'Betsy, I must get away to the poor girl straight.' To be
sure I had enough on my hands already, but I couldn't leave you to
strangers, could I?"</p>
<p>Hearing no response to this question, Aunt Bridget went on to
say that what was coming would be a bond between me and my
husband.</p>
<p>"It always is. It was in my case, anyway. The old colonel didn't
behave very well after our marriage, and times and times I was
telling myself I had made a rue bargain; but when Betsy came I
thought, 'I might have done better, but I might have done worse,
and he's the father of my offspring, anyway.'"</p>
<p>Hearing no response to this either, Aunt Bridget went on to talk
of Alma and her mother. Was not this the woman I suspected with my
husband&mdash;the young one with the big eyes and "the quality toss
with her?" Then why did I have a person like that about the
house?</p>
<p>"If you need bright and cheerful company, what's amiss with your
aunt and your first cousin? Some people are selfish, but I thank
the saints I don't know what selfishness is. I'm willing to do for
you what I did for your poor mother, and <i>I</i> can't say more
than that, can I?"</p>
<p>I must have made some kind of response, for Aunt Bridget went on
to say it might be a sacrifice, but then she wouldn't be sorry to
leave the Big House either.</p>
<p>"I'm twenty years there, and now I'm to be a servant to my own
stepchild. Dear heart knows if I can bear it much longer. The way
that Nessy is carrying on with your father is something shocking. I
do believe she'll marry the man some day."</p>
<p>To escape from a painful topic I asked after my father's
health.</p>
<p>"Worse and worse, but Conrad's news was like laughing-gas to the
man. He would have come with me to-day, but the doctor wouldn't
hear of it. He'll come soon though, and meantime he's talking and
talking about a great entertainment."</p>
<p>"Entertainment?"</p>
<p>"To celebrate the forthcoming event, of course, though nobody is
to know that except ourselves, it seems. Just a house-warming in
honour of your coming home after your marriage&mdash;that's all
it's to be on the outside, anyway."</p>
<p>I made some cry of pain, and Aunt Bridget said:</p>
<p>"Oh, I know what you're going to say&mdash;why doesn't he wait?
I'll tell you why if you'll promise not to whisper a word to any
one. Your father is a sick man, my dear. Let him say what he likes
when Conrad talks about cancer, he knows Death's hand is over him.
And thinking it may fall before your time has come, he wants to
take time by the forelock and see a sort of fulfilment of the hope
of his life&mdash;and you know what that is."</p>
<p>It was terrible. The position in which I stood towards my father
was now so tragic that (wicked as it was) I prayed with all my
heart that I might never look upon his face again.</p>
<p>I was compelled to do so. Three days after Aunt Bridget's visit
my father came to see me. The day was fine and I was walking on the
lawn when his big car came rolling up the drive.</p>
<p>I was shocked to see the change in him. His face was ghastly
white, his lips were blue, his massive and powerful head seemed to
have sunk into his shoulders, and his limbs were so thin that his
clothes seemed to hang on them; but the stern mouth was there
still, and so was the masterful lift of the eyebrows.</p>
<p>Coming over to meet me with an uncertain step, he said:</p>
<p>"Old Conrad was for keeping me in bed, but I couldn't take rest
without putting a sight on you."</p>
<p>After that, and some plain speech out of the primitive man he
always was and will be (about it's being good for a woman to have
children because it saved her from "losing her stomach" over
imaginary grievances), he led me, with the same half-contemptuous
tenderness which he used to show to my mother, back to the house
and into the drawing-room.</p>
<p>Alma and her mother were there, the one writing at a desk, the
other knitting on the sofa, and they rose as my father entered, but
he waved them back to their places.</p>
<p>"Set down, ma'am. Take your seat, mother. I'm only here for a
minute to talk to my gel about her great reception."</p>
<p>"Reception?" said Alma.</p>
<p>"Hasn't she told you about it?" he said, and being answered that
I had not, he gave a rough outline of his project, whereupon Alma,
whose former attitude towards my father had changed to one of
flattery and subservience, lifted her hands and cried:</p>
<p>"How splendid! Such an inspiration! Only think, my love, you
were to be kept bright and cheerful, and what could be better for
that purpose?"</p>
<p>In the torment of my soul I urged one objection after
another&mdash;it would be expensive, we could not afford it.</p>
<p>"Who asks you to afford it? It's my affair, isn't it?" said my
father.</p>
<p>I was unwell, and therefore unable to undertake the hard work of
such an entertainment&mdash;but that was the worst of excuses, for
Alma jumped in with an offer of assistance.</p>
<p>"My dearest child," she said, "you know how happy I shall be to
help you. In fact, I'll do all the work and you shall have all the
glory."</p>
<p>"There you are, then," cried my father, slapping me on the
shoulder, and then, turning to Alma, he told her to set to work
without a day's delay.</p>
<p>"Let everything be done correct even if it costs me a bit of
money."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir."</p>
<p>"A rael big thing, ma'am, such as nobody has ever seen
before."</p>
<p>"Yes indeed, sir."</p>
<p>"Ask all the big people on the island&mdash;Nessy MacLeod shall
send you a list of them."</p>
<p>"I will, sir."</p>
<p>"That'll do for the present&mdash;I guess I must be going now,
or old Conrad will be agate of me. So long, gel, so long."</p>
<p>I was silenced, I was helpless, I was ashamed.</p>
<p>I did not know then, what now I know, that, besides the desire
of celebrating the forthcoming birth of an heir, my father had
another and still more secret object&mdash;that of throwing dust in
the eyes of his advocates, bankers, and insular councillors, who
(having expected him to make money for them by magic) were
beginning to whisper that all was not well with his financial
schemes.</p>
<p>I did not know then, what now I know, that my father was at that
moment the most tragic figure in Ellan except myself, and that,
shattered in health and shaken in fortune, he was indulging in this
wild extravagance equally to assert his solvency and to gratify his
lifelong passion under the very wing of Death.</p>
<p>But oh, my wild woe, my frantic prayers! It was almost as if
Satan himself were torturing me.</p>
<p>The one terror of the next few days was that my husband might
return home, for I knew that at the first moment of his arrival the
whole world of make-believe which my father and Alma were setting
up around me would tumble about my head like a pack of cards.</p>
<p>He did not come, but he wrote. After saying that his political
duties would keep him in London a little longer, he said:</p>
<p>"I hear that your father is getting you to give a great
reception in honour of our home-coming. But why <i>now</i>, instead
of three months ago? <i>Do you know the reason?</i>"</p>
<p>As I read these last words I felt an icy numbness creeping up
from my feet to my heart. My position was becoming intolerable. The
conviction was being forced upon me that I had no right in my
husband's house.</p>
<p>It made no difference that my husband's house was mine also, in
the sense that it could not exist without me&mdash;I had no right
to be there.</p>
<p>It made no difference that my marriage had been no
marriage&mdash;I had no right to be there.</p>
<p>It made no difference that the man I had married was an utterly
bad husband&mdash;I had no right to be there.</p>
<p>It made no difference that I was not really an adulterous
wife&mdash;I had no right to be there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Price, my maid, but my only real friend in Castle Raa,
with the liberty I allowed her, was unconsciously increasing my
torture. Every night as she combed out my hair she gave me her
opinion of my attitude towards Alma, and one night she said:</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell you she was only watching you, my lady? The
nasty-minded thing is making mischief with his lordship. She's
writing to him every day. . . . How do I know? Oh, I don't keep my
eyes and my ears open downstairs for nothing. You'll have no peace
of your life, my lady, until you turn that woman out of the
house."</p>
<p>Then in a fit of despair, hardly knowing what I was doing, I
covered my face with my hands and said:</p>
<p>"I had better turn myself out instead, perhaps."</p>
<p>The combing of my hair suddenly stopped, and at the next moment
I heard Price saying in a voice which seemed to come from a long
way off:</p>
<p>"Goodness gracious me! Is it like that, my lady?"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SEVENTY_FIFTH_CHAPTER" id=
"SEVENTY_FIFTH_CHAPTER"></a>SEVENTY-FIFTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Alma was as good as her word.</p>
<p>She did everything without consulting me&mdash;fixed the date of
the reception for a month after the day of my father's visit, and
sent out invitations to all "the insular gentry" included in the
lists which came from Nessy MacLeod in her stiff and formal
handwriting.</p>
<p>These lists came morning after morning, until the invitations
issued reached the grand total of five hundred.</p>
<p>As the rooms of the Castle were not large enough to accommodate
so many guests, Alma proposed to erect a temporary pavilion. My
father agreed, and within a week hundreds of workmen from
Blackwater were setting up a vast wooden structure, in the form of
the Colosseum, on the headlands beyond the garden where Martin and
I had walked together.</p>
<p>While the work went on my father's feverish pride seemed to
increase. I heard of messages to Alma saying that no money was to
be spared. The reception was to surpass in grandeur any f&ecirc;te
ever held in Ellan. Not knowing what high stakes my father was
playing for, I was frightened by this extravagance, and from that
cause alone I wished to escape from the sight of it.</p>
<p>I could not escape.</p>
<p>I felt sure that Alma hated me with an implacable hatred, and
that she was trying to drive me away, thinking that would be the
easiest means to gain her own ends. For this reason, among others,
the woman in me would not let me fly, so I remained and went
through a purgatory of suffering.</p>
<p>Price, too, who had reconciled herself to my revelation, was
always urging me to remain, saying:</p>
<p>"Why should you go, my lady? You are your husband's wife, aren't
you? Fight it out, I say. Ladies do so every day. Why shouldn't
you?"</p>
<p>Before long the whole island seemed to be astir about our
reception. Every day the insular newspapers devoted columns to the
event, giving elaborate accounts of what limitless wealth could
accomplish for a single night's entertainment. In these
descriptions there was much eulogy of my father as "the uncrowned
king of Ellan," as well as praise of Alma, who was "displaying such
daring originality," but little or no mention of myself.</p>
<p>Nevertheless everybody seemed to understand the inner meaning of
the forthcoming reception, and in the primitive candour of our
insular manners some of the visits I received were painfully
embarrassing.</p>
<p>One of the first to come was my father's advocate, Mr. Curphy,
who smiled his usual bland smile and combed his long beard while he
thanked me for acting on his advice not to allow a fit of pique to
break up a marriage which was so suitable from points of property
and position.</p>
<p>"How happy your father must be to see the fulfilment of his
hopes," he said. "Just when his health is failing him, too! How
good! How gratifying!"</p>
<p>The next to come was the Bishop, who, smooth and suave as ever,
congratulated me on putting aside all thoughts of divorce, so that
the object of my marriage might be fulfilled and a good Catholic
become the heir of Castle Raa.</p>
<p>More delicate, but also more distressing, was a letter from
Father Dan, saying he had been forbidden my husband's house and
therefore could not visit me, but having heard an angel's whisper
of the sweet joy that was coming to me, he prayed the Lord and His
Holy Mother to carry me safely through.</p>
<p>"I have said a rosary for you every day since you were here, my
dear child, that you might be saved from a great temptation. And
now I know you have been, and the sacrament of your holy marriage
has fulfilled its mission, as I always knew it would. So God bless
you, my daughter, and keep you pure and fit for eternal union with
that blessed saint, your mother, whom the Lord has made His
own."</p>
<p>More than ever after this letter I felt that I must fly from my
husband's house, but, thinking of Alma, my wounded pride, my
outraged vanity (as I say, the <i>woman</i> in me), would not let
me go.</p>
<p>Three weeks passed.</p>
<p>The pavilion had been built and was being hung with gaily
painted bannerets to give the effect of the Colosseum as seen at
sunset. A covered corridor connecting the theatre with the house
was being lined with immense hydrangeas and lit from the roof by
lamps that resembled stars.</p>
<p>A few days before the day fixed for the event Alma, who had been
too much occupied to see me every day in the boudoir to which I
confined myself, came up to give me my instructions.</p>
<p>The entertainment was to begin at ten o'clock. I was to be
dressed as Cleopatra and to receive my guests in the drawing-room.
At the sound of a fanfare of trumpets I was to go into the theatre
preceded by a line of pages, and accompanied by my husband. After
we had taken our places in a private box a great ballet, brought
specially from a London music-hall, was to give a performance
lasting until midnight. Then there was to be a cotillon, led by
Alma herself with my husband, and after supper the dancing was to
be resumed and kept up until sunrise, when a basketful of
butterflies and doves (sent from the South of France) were to be
liberated from cages, and to rise in a multicoloured cloud through
the sunlit space.</p>
<p>I was sick and ashamed when I thought of this vain and gaudy
scene and the object which I supposed it was intended to serve.</p>
<p>The end of it all was that I wrote to my father, concealing the
real cause of my suffering, but telling him he could not possibly
be aware of what was being done in his name and with his money, and
begging him to put an end to the entertainment altogether.</p>
<p>The only answer I received was a visit from Nessy MacLeod. I can
see her still as she came into my room, the tall gaunt figure with
red hair and irregular features.</p>
<p>"Cousin Mary," she said, seating herself stiffly on the only
stiff-backed chair, and speaking in an impassive tone, "your letter
has been received, but your father has not seen it, his health
being such as makes it highly undesirable that he should be
disturbed by unnecessary worries."</p>
<p>I answered with some warmth that my letter had not been
unnecessary, but urgent and important, and if she persisted in
withholding it from my father I should deliver it myself.</p>
<p>"Cousin Mary," said Nessy, "I know perfectly what your letter
is, having opened and read it, and while I am as little as yourself
in sympathy with what is going on here, I happen to know that your
father has set his heart on this entertainment, and therefore I do
not choose that it shall be put off."</p>
<p>I replied hotly that in opening my letter to my father she had
taken an unwarrantable liberty, and then (losing myself a little) I
asked her by what right did she, who had entered my father's house
as a dependent, dare to keep his daughter's letter from him.</p>
<p>"Cousin Mary," said Nessy, in the same impassive tone, "you were
always self-willed, selfish, and most insulting as a child, and I
am sorry to see that neither marriage nor education at a convent
has chastened your ungovernable temper. But I have told you that I
do not choose that you shall injure your father's health by
disturbing his plans, and you shall certainly not do so."</p>
<p>"Then take care," I answered, "that in protecting my father's
health you do not destroy it altogether."</p>
<p>In spite of her cold and savourless nature, she understood my
meaning, for after a moment of silence she said:</p>
<p>"Cousin Mary, you may do exactly as you please. Your conduct in
the future, whatever it may be, will be no affair of mine, and I
shall not consider that I am in any way responsible for it."</p>
<p>At last I began to receive anonymous letters. They came from
various parts of Ellan and appeared to be in different
handwritings. Some of them advised me to fly from the island, and
others enclosed a list of steamers' sailings.</p>
<p>Only a woman who has been the victim of this species of cowardly
torture can have any idea of the shame of it, and again and again I
asked myself if I ought not to escape from my husband's house
before he returned.</p>
<p>But Price seemed to find a secret joy in the anonymous letters,
saying she believed she knew the source of them: and one evening
towards the end, she came running into my room with a shawl over
her head, a look of triumph in her face, and an unopened letter in
her hand.</p>
<p>"There!" she said. "It's all up with Madame now. You've got the
game in your own hands, my lady, and can send them all
packing."</p>
<p>The letter was addressed to my husband in London. Price had
seized the arm of Alma's maid in the act of posting it, and under
threat of the law (not to speak of instant personal chastisement)
the girl had confessed that both this letter and others had been
written by our housekeeper under the inspiration of her
mistress.</p>
<p>Without any compunction Price broke the seal of the intercepted
letter and read it aloud to me. It was a shocking thing, accusing
me with Martin, and taunting my husband with the falseness of the
forthcoming entertainment.</p>
<p>Feeling too degraded to speak, I took the letter in silence out
of my maid's hands, and while I was in the act of locking it away
in a drawer Alma came up with a telegram from my husband, saying he
was leaving London by the early train the following morning and
would arrive at Blackwater at half-past three in the afternoon.</p>
<p>"Dear old Jimmy!" she said, "what a surprise you have in store
for him! But of course you've told him already, haven't you? . . .
No? Ah, I see, you've been saving it all up to tell him face to
face. Oh, happy, happy you!"</p>
<p>It was too late to leave now. The hour of my trial had come.
There was no possibility of escape. It was just as if Satan had
been holding me in the net of my sin, so that I could not fly
away.</p>
<p>At three o'clock next day (which was the day before the day
fixed for the reception) I heard the motor-car going off to meet my
husband at Blackwater. At four o'clock I heard it return. A few
minutes afterwards I heard my husband's voice in the hall. I
thought he would come up to me directly, but he did not do so, and
I did not attempt to go down. When, after a while, I asked what had
become of him, I was told that he was in the library with Alma, and
that they were alone.</p>
<p>Two hours passed.</p>
<p>To justify and fortify myself I thought how badly my husband had
behaved to me. I remembered that he had married me from the most
mercenary motives; that he had paid off his mistress with the money
that came through me; that he had killed by cruelty the efforts I
had made to love him; that he had humiliated me by gross
infidelities committed on my honeymoon. I recalled the scenes in
Rome, the scenes in Paris, and the insults I had received under my
own roof.</p>
<p>It was all in vain. Whether God means it that the woman's fault
in breaking her marriage vows (whatever her sufferings and excuse)
shall be greater than that of the man I do not know. I only know
that I was trembling like a prisoner before her judge when, being
dressed for dinner and waiting for the sound of the bell, I heard
my husband's footsteps approach my door.</p>
<p>I was standing by the fire at that moment, and I held on to the
mantelpiece as my husband came into the room.</p>

"SEVENTY_SIXTH_CHAPTER"></a>SEVENTY-SIXTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>He was very pale. The look of hardness, almost of brutality,
which pierced his manner at normal moments had deepened, and I
could see at a glance that he was nervous. His monocle dropped of
itself from his slow grey eyes, and the white fat fingers which
replaced it trembled.</p>
<p>Without shaking hands or offering any other sort of salutation
he plunged immediately into the matter that was uppermost in his
mind.</p>
<p>"I am still at a loss to account for this affair of your
father's," he said. "Of course I know what it is supposed to
be&mdash;a reception in honour of our home-coming. That explanation
may or may not be sufficient for these stupid islanders, but it's
rather too thin for me. Can you tell me what your father means by
it?"</p>
<p>I knew he knew what my father meant, so I said, trembling like a
sheep that walks up to a barking dog:</p>
<p>"Hadn't you better ask that question of my father himself?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps I should if he were here, but he isn't, so I ask you.
Your father is a strange man. There's no knowing what crude things
he will not do to gratify his primitive instincts. But he does not
spend five or ten thousand pounds for nothing. He isn't a fool
exactly."</p>
<p>"Thank you," I said. I could not help it. It was forced out of
me.</p>
<p>My husband flinched and looked at me. Then the bully in him,
which always lay underneath, came uppermost.</p>
<p>"Look here, Mary," he said. "I came for an explanation and I
intend to have one. Your father may give this affair what gloss he
pleases, but you must know as well as I do what rumour and report
are saying, so we might as well speak plainly. Is it the fact that
the doctor has made certain statements about your own condition,
and that your father is giving this entertainment because . . .
well, because he is expecting an heir?"</p>
<p>To my husband's astonishment I answered:</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"So you admit it? Then perhaps you'll be good enough to tell me
how that condition came about?"</p>
<p>Knowing he needed no explanation, I made no answer.</p>
<p>"Can't you speak?" he said.</p>
<p>But still I remained silent.</p>
<p>"You know what our relations have been since our marriage, so I
ask you again how does that condition come about?"</p>
<p>I was now trembling more than ever, but a kind of forced courage
came to me and I said:</p>
<p>"Why do you ask? You seem to know already."</p>
<p>"I know what anonymous letters have told me, if that's what you
mean. But I'm your husband and have a right to know from
<i>you</i>. How does your condition come about, I ask you?"</p>
<p>I cannot say what impulse moved me at that moment unless it was
the desire to make a clean breast and an end of everything, but,
stepping to my desk, I took out of a drawer the letter which Price
had intercepted and threw it on the table.</p>
<p>He took it up and read it, with the air of one to whom the
contents were not news, and then asked how I came by it.</p>
<p>"It was taken out of the hands of a woman who was in the act of
posting it," I said. "She confessed that it was one of a number of
such letters which had been inspired, if not written, by your
friend Alma."</p>
<p>"My friend Alma!"</p>
<p>"Yes, your friend Alma."</p>
<p>His face assumed a frightful expression and he said:</p>
<p>"So that's how it is to be, is it? In spite of the admission you
have just made you wish to imply that this" (holding out the
letter) "is a trumped-up affair, and that Alma is at the bottom of
it. You're going to brazen it out, are you, and shelter your
condition under your position as a married woman?"</p>
<p>I was so taken by surprise by this infamous suggestion that I
could not speak to deny it, and my husband went on to say:</p>
<p>"But it doesn't matter a rush to me who is at the bottom of the
accusation contained in this letter. There's only one thing of any
consequence&mdash;is it true?"</p>
<p>My head was reeling, my eyes were dim, my palms were moist, I
felt as if I were throwing myself over a precipice but I
answered:</p>
<p>"It is perfectly true."</p>
<p>I think that was the last thing he expected. After a moment he
said:</p>
<p>"Then you have broken your marriage vows&mdash;is that it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, if you call it so."</p>
<p>"Call it so? Call it so? Good heavens, what do <i>you</i> call
it?"</p>
<p>I did not reply, and after another moment he said:</p>
<p>"But perhaps you wish me to understand that this man whom I was
so foolish as to invite to my house abused my hospitality and
betrayed my wife. Is that what you mean?"</p>
<p>"No," I said. "He observed the laws of hospitality much better
than you did, and if I am betrayed I betrayed myself."</p>
<p>I shall never forget the look with which my husband received
this confession. He drew himself up with the air of an injured man
and said:</p>
<p>"What? You mean that you yourself . . . deliberately . . . Good
God!"</p>
<p>He stopped for a moment and then said with a rush:</p>
<p>"I suppose you've not forgotten what happened at the time of our
marriage . . . your resistance and the ridiculous compact I
submitted to? Why did I submit? Because I thought your innocence,
your convent-bred ideas, and your ignorance of the first conditions
of matrimony. . . . But I've been fooled, for you now tell me . . .
after all my complacency . . . that you have deliberately. . . . In
the name of God do you know what you are? There's only one name for
a woman who does what you've done. Do you want me to tell you what
that name is?"</p>
<p>I was quivering with shame, but my mind, which was going at
lightning speed, was thinking of London, of Cairo, of Rome, and of
Paris.</p>
<p>"Why don't you speak?" he cried, lifting his voice in his rage.
"Don't you understand what a letter like this is calling you?"</p>
<p>My heart choked. But the thought that came to me&mdash;that, bad
as his own life had been, he considered he had a right to treat me
in this way because he was a man and I was a woman&mdash;brought
strength out of my weakness, so that when he went on to curse my
Church and my religion, saying this was all that had come of "the
mummery of my masses," I fired up for a moment and said:</p>
<p>"You can spare yourself these blasphemies. If I have done wrong,
it is I, and not my Church, that is to blame for it."</p>
<p>"<i>If</i> you have done wrong!" he cried. "Damn it, have you
lost all sense of a woman's duty to her husband? While you have
been married to me and I have been fool enough not to claim you as
a wife because I thought you were only fit company for the saints
and angels, you have been prostituting yourself to this blusterer,
this . . ."</p>
<p>"That is a lie," I said, stepping up to him in the middle of the
floor. "It's true that I am married to you, but <i>he</i> is my
real husband and you . . . you are nothing to me at all."</p>
<p>My husband stood for a moment with his mouth agape. Then he
began to laugh&mdash;loudly, derisively, mockingly.</p>
<p>"Nothing to you, am I? You don't mind bearing my name, though,
and when your time comes you'll expect it to cover your
disgrace."</p>
<p>His face had become shockingly distorted. He was quivering with
fury.</p>
<p>"That's not the worst, either," he cried. "It's not enough that
you should tell me to my face that somebody else is your real
husband, but you must shunt your spurious offspring into my house.
Isn't that what it all comes to . . . all this damnable fuss of
your father's . . . that you are going to palm off on me and my
name and family your own and this man's . . . bastard?"</p>
<p>And with the last word, in the drunkenness of his rage, he
lifted his arm and struck me with the back of his hand across the
cheek.</p>
<p>The physical shock was fearful, but the moral infamy was a
hundred-fold worse. I can truly say that not alone for myself did I
suffer. When my mind, still going at lightning speed, thought of
Martin, who loved me so tenderly, I felt crushed by my husband's
blow to the lowest depths of shame.</p>
<p>I must have screamed, though I did not know it, for at the next
moment Price was in the room and I saw that the housekeeper (drawn
perhaps, as before, by my husband's loud voice) was on the landing
outside the door. But even that did not serve to restrain him.</p>
<p>"No matter," he said. "After what has passed you may not enjoy
to-morrow's ceremony. But you shall go through it! By heaven, you
shall! And when it is over, I shall have something to say to your
father."</p>
<p>And with that he swung out of the room and went lunging down the
stairs.</p>
<p>I was still standing in the middle of the floor, with the blow
from my husband's hand tingling on my cheek, when Price, after
clashing the door in the face of the housekeeper, said, with her
black eyes ablaze:</p>
<p>"Well, if ever I wanted to be a man before to-day!"</p>
<p>News of the scene went like wildfire through the house, and
Alma's mother came to comfort me. In her crude and blundering way
she told me of a similar insult she had suffered at the hands of
the "bad Lord Raa," and how it had been the real reason of her
going to America.</p>
<p>"Us married ladies have much to put up with. But cheer up,
dearie. I guess you'll have gotten over it by to-morrow
morning."</p>
<p>When she was gone I sat down before the fire. I did not cry. I
felt as if I had reached a depth of suffering that was a thousand
fathoms too deep for tears. I do not think I wept again for many
months afterwards, and then it was a great joy, not a great grief,
that brought me a burst of blessed tears.</p>
<p>But I could hear my dear good Price crying behind me, and when I
said:</p>
<p>"Now you see for yourself that I cannot remain in this house any
longer," she answered, in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Yes, my lady."</p>
<p>"I must go at once&mdash;to-night if possible."</p>
<p>"You shall. Leave everything to me, my lady."</p>

<h2><a name="SEVENTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"SEVENTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER"></a>SEVENTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>The bell rang, but of course I did not go down to dinner.</p>
<p>As soon as Price had gone off to make the necessary arrangements
I turned the key in the lock of my door, removed my evening gown,
and began to dress for my flight.</p>
<p>My brain was numb, but I did my best to confront the new
situation that was before me.</p>
<p>Hitherto I had been occupied with the problem of whether I
should or should not leave my husband's house; now I had to settle
the question of where I was to go to.</p>
<p>I dared not think of home, for (Nessy MacLeod and Aunt Bridget
apart) the house of my father was the last place I could fly to at
a moment when I was making dust and ashes of his lifelong
expectations.</p>
<p>Neither dared I think of Sunny Lodge, although I remembered,
with a tug of tenderness, Christian Ann's last message about Mary
O'Neill's little room that was always waiting for me&mdash;for I
thought of how I had broken my pledge to her.</p>
<p>The only place I could think of was that which Martin had
mentioned when he wished to carry me away&mdash;London. In the
mighty world of London I might hide myself from observation and
wait until Martin returned from his expedition.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, London," I told myself in my breathless excitement,
little knowing what London meant.</p>
<p>I began to select the clothes I was to carry with me and to wear
on my journey. They must be plain, for I had to escape from a house
in which unfriendly eyes would be watching me. They must be
durable, for during my time of waiting I expected to be poor.</p>
<p>I hunted out some of the quaker-like costumes which had been
made for me before my marriage; and when I had put them on I saw
that they made a certain deduction from my appearance, but that did
not matter to me now&mdash;the only eyes I wished to look well in
being down in the Antarctic seas.</p>
<p>Then I tried to think of practical matters&mdash;how I was to
live in London and how, in particular, I was to meet the situation
that was before me. Surely never did a more helpless innocent
confront such a serious problem. I was a woman, and for more than a
year I had been a wife, but I had no more experience of the hard
facts of material existence than a child.</p>
<p>I thought first of the bank-book which my father had sent me
with authority to draw on his account. But it was then nine
o'clock, the banks were closed for the day, and I knew enough of
the world to see that if I attempted to cash a cheque in the
morning my whereabouts would he traced. That must never happen, I
must hide myself from everybody; therefore my bank-book was
useless.</p>
<p>"Quite useless," I thought, throwing it aside like so much waste
paper.</p>
<p>I thought next of my jewels. But there I encountered a similar
difficulty. The jewels which were really mine, having been bought
by myself, had been gambled away by my husband at Monte Carlo. What
remained were the family jewels which had come to me as Lady Raa;
but that was a name I was never more to bear, a person I was never
more to think about, so I could not permit myself to take anything
that belonged to her.</p>
<p>The only thing left to me was my money. I had always kept a good
deal of it about me, although the only use I had had for it was to
put it in the plate at church, and to scatter it with foolish
prodigality to the boys who tossed somersaults behind the carriage
in the road.</p>
<p>Now I found it all over my room&mdash;in my purse, in various
drawers, and on the toilet-tray under my dressing-glass. Gathered
together it counted up to twenty-eight pounds. I owed four pounds
to Price, and having set them aside, I saw that I had twenty-four
pounds left in notes, gold, and silver.</p>
<p>Being in the literal and unconventional sense utterly ignorant
of the value of sixpence, I thought this a great sum, amply
sufficient for all my needs, or at least until I secured
employment&mdash;for I had from the first some vague idea of
earning my own living.</p>
<p>"Martin would like that," I told myself, lifting my head with a
thrill of pride.</p>
<p>Then I began to gather up the treasures which were inexpressibly
more dear to me than all my other possessions.</p>
<p>One of them was a little miniature of my mother which Father Dan
had given me for a wedding-present when (as I know now) he would
rather have parted with his heart's blood.</p>
<p>Another was a pearl rosary which the Reverend Mother had dropped
over my arm the last time she kissed me on the forehead; and the
last was my Martin's misspelt love-letter, which was more precious
to me than rubies.</p>
<p>Not for worlds, I thought, would I leave these behind me, or
ever part with them under any circumstances.</p>
<p>Several times while I was busy with such preparations, growing
more and more nervous every moment, Price came on tip-toe and
tapped softly at my door.</p>
<p>Once it was to bring me some food and to tell me, with many
winks (for the good soul herself was trembling with excitement),
that everything was "as right as ninepence." I should get away
without difficulty in a couple of hours, and until to-morrow
morning nobody would be a penny the wiser.</p>
<p>Fortunately it was Thursday, when a combined passenger and cargo
steamer sailed to Liverpool. Of course the motor-car would not be
available to take me to the pier, but Tommy the Mate, who had a
stiff cart in which he took his surplus products to market, would
be waiting for me at eleven o'clock by the gate to the high
road.</p>
<p>The people downstairs, meaning my husband and Alma and her
mother, were going off to the pavilion (where hundreds of
decorators were to work late and the orchestra and ballet were to
have a rehearsal), and they had been heard to say that they would
not be back until "way round about midnight."</p>
<p>"But the servants?" I asked.</p>
<p>"They're going too, bless them," said Price. "So eat your dinner
in peace, my lady, and don't worry about a thing until I come back
to fetch you."</p>
<p>Another hour passed. I was in a fever of apprehension. I felt
like a prisoner who was about to escape from a dungeon.</p>
<p>A shrill wind was coming up from the sea and whistling about the
house. I could hear the hammering of the workmen in the pavilion as
well as the music of the orchestra practising their scores.</p>
<p>A few minutes before eleven Price returned, carrying one of the
smaller of the travelling-trunks I had taken to Cairo. I noticed
that it bore no name and no initials.</p>
<p>"It's all right," she said. "They've gone off, every mother's
son and daughter of them&mdash;all except the housekeeper, and I've
caught her out, the cat!"</p>
<p>That lynx-eyed person had begun to suspect. She had seen Tommy
harnessing his horse and had not been satisfied with his
explanation&mdash;that he was taking tomatoes to Blackwater to be
sent off by the Liverpool steamer.</p>
<p>So to watch events, without seeming to watch them, the
housekeeper (when the other servants had gone off to the rehearsal)
had stolen upstairs to her room in the West tower overlooking the
back courtyard.</p>
<p>But Price had been more than a match for her. Creeping up
behind, she had locked the door of the top landing, and now the
"little cat" might scream her head off through the window, and
(over the noises of the wind and the workmen) it would be only like
"tom" shrieking on the tiles.</p>
<p>"We must be quick, though," said Price, tumbling into my
travelling-trunk as many of my clothes as it would hold.</p>
<p>When it was full and locked and corded she said:</p>
<p>"Wait," and stepped out on the landing to listen.</p>
<p>After a moment she returned saying:</p>
<p>"Not a sound! Now for it, my lady."</p>
<p>And then, tying her handkerchief over her head to keep down her
hair in the wind, she picked up the trunk in her arms and crept out
of the room on tiptoe.</p>
<p>The moment had come to go, yet, eager as I had been all evening
to escape from my husband's house, I could scarcely tear myself
away, for I was feeling a little of that regret which comes to us
all when we are doing something for the last time.</p>
<p>Passing through the boudoir this feeling took complete
possession of me. Only a few hours before it had been the scene of
my deepest degradation, but many a time before it had been the
place of my greatest happiness.</p>
<p><i>"You are my wife. I am your real husband. No matter where you
are or what they do with you, you are mine and always will
be."</i></p>
<p>Half-closing the door, I took a last look round&mdash;at the
piano, the desk, the table, the fireplace, all the simple things
associated with my dearest memories. So strong was the yearning of
my own soul that I felt as if the soul of Martin were in the room
with me at that moment.</p>
<p>I believe it was.</p>
<p>"Quick, my lady, or you'll lose your steamer," whispered Price,
and then we crossed the landing (which was creaking again) and
crept noiselessly down a back staircase. We were near the bottom
when I was startled by a loud knocking, which seemed to come from a
distant part of the house. My heart temporarily stopped its
beating, but Price only laughed and whispered:</p>
<p>"There she is! We've fairly caught her out, the cat."</p>
<p>At the next moment Price opened an outer door, and after we had
passed through she closed and locked it behind us.</p>
<p>We were then in the courtyard behind the house, stumbling in the
blinding darkness over cobble-stones.</p>
<p>"Keep close to me, my lady," said Price.</p>
<p>After a few moments we reached the drive. I think I was more
nervous than I had ever been before. I heard the withered leaves
behind me rustling along the ground before the wind from the sea,
and thought they were the footsteps of people pursuing us. I heard
the hammering of the workmen and the music of the orchestra, and
thought they were voices screaming to us to come back.</p>
<p>Price, who was forging ahead, carried the trunk in her arms as
if it had been a child, but every few minutes she waited for me to
come up to her, and encouraged me when I stumbled in the
darkness.</p>
<p>"Only a little further, my lady," she said, and I did my best to
struggle on.</p>
<p>We reached the gate to the high road at last. Tommy the Mate was
there with his stiff cart, and Price, who was breathless after her
great exertion, tumbled my trunk over the tail-board.</p>
<p>The time had come to part from her, and, remembering how
faithful and true she had been to me, I hardly knew what to say. I
told her I had left her wages in an envelope on the dressing-table,
and then I stammered something about being too poor to make her a
present to remember me by.</p>
<p>"It doesn't need a present to help me to remember a good
mistress, my lady," she said.</p>
<p>"God bless you for being so good to me," I answered, and then I
kissed her.</p>
<p>"I'll remember you by that, though," she said, and she began to
cry.</p>
<p>I climbed over the wheel of the stiff cart and seated myself on
my trunk, and then Tommy, who had been sitting on the front-board
with his feet on the outer shaft, whipped up his horse and we
started away.</p>
<p>During the next half-hour the springless cart bobbed along the
dark road at its slow monotonous pace. Tommy never once looked
round or spoke except to his horse, but I understood my old friend
perfectly.</p>
<p>I was in a fever of anxiety lest I should be overtaken and
carried back. Again and again I looked behind. At one moment, when
a big motor-car, with its two great white eyes, came rolling up
after us, my stormy heart stood still. But it was not my husband's
car, and in a little while its red tail-light disappeared in the
darkness ahead.</p>
<p>We reached Blackwater in time for the midnight steamer and drew
up at the landward end of the pier. It was cold; the salt wind from
the sea was very chill. Men who looked like commercial travellers
were hurrying along with their coat-collars turned up, and porters
with heavy trunks on their shoulders were striving to keep pace
with them.</p>
<p>I gave my own trunk to a porter who came up to the cart, and
then turned to Tommy to say good-bye. The old man had got down from
the shaft and was smoothing his smoking horse, and snuffling as if
he had caught a cold.</p>
<p>"Good-bye, Tommy," I said&mdash;and then something more which I
do not wish to write down.</p>
<p>"Good-bye, lil missie," he answered (that cut me deep), "I never
believed ould Tom Dug would live to see ye laving home like this .
. . But wait! Only wait till himself is after coming back, and I'll
go bail it'll be the divil sit up for some of them."</p>

"SEVENTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER"></a>SEVENTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>It was very dark. No more than three or four lamps on the pier
were burning, but nevertheless I was afraid that the pier-master
would recognise me.</p>
<p>I thought he did so as I approached the gangway to the saloon,
for he said:</p>
<p>"Private cabin on main deck aft."</p>
<p>Nervous as I was, I had just enough presence of mind to say
"Steerage, please," which threw him off the scent entirely, so that
he cried, in quite a different voice:</p>
<p>"Steerage passengers forward."</p>
<p>I found my way to the steerage end of the steamer; and in order
to escape observation from the few persons on the pier I went down
to the steerage cabin, which was a little triangular place in the
bow, with an open stove in the middle of the floor and a bleary
oil-lamp swinging from a rafter overhead.</p>
<p>The porter found me there, and in my foolish ignorance of the
value of money I gave him half a crown for his trouble. He first
looked at the coin, then tested it between his teeth, then spat on
it, and finally went off chuckling.</p>
<p>The first and second bells rang. I grudged every moment of delay
before the steamer sailed, for I still felt like a prisoner who was
running away and might even yet be brought back.</p>
<p>Seating myself in the darkest corner of the cabin, I waited and
watched. There were only two other steerage passengers and they
were women. Judging by their conversation I concluded that they
were cooks from lodging-houses on "the front," returning after a
long season to their homes in Liverpool. Both were very tired, and
they were spreading their blankets on the bare bunks so as to
settle themselves for the night.</p>
<p>At last the third bell rang. I heard the engine whistle, the
funnel belch out its smoke, the hawsers being thrown off, the
gangways being taken in, and then, looking through the porthole, I
saw the grey pier gliding behind us.</p>
<p>After a few moments, with a feeling of safety and a sense of
danger passed, I went up on deck. But oh, how little I knew what
bitter pain I was putting myself to!</p>
<p>We were just then swinging round the lighthouse which stands on
the south-east headland of the bay, and the flash of its revolving
light in my face as I reached the top of the cabin stairs brought
back the memory of the joyous and tumultuous scenes of Martin's
last departure.</p>
<p>That, coupled and contrasted with the circumstances of my own
flight, stealthily, shamefully, and in the dead of night, gave me a
pang that was almost more than I could bear.</p>
<p>But my cup was not yet full. A few minutes afterwards we sailed
in the dark past the two headlands of Port Raa, and, looking up, I
saw the lights in the windows of my husband's house, and the glow
over the glass roof of the pavilion.</p>
<p>What would happen there to-morrow morning when it was discovered
that I was gone? What would happen to-morrow night when my father
arrived, ignorant of my flight, as I felt sure the malice of my
husband would keep him?</p>
<p>Little as I knew then of my father's real motives in giving that
bizarre and rather vulgar entertainment, I thought I saw and heard
everything that would occur.</p>
<p>I saw the dazzling spectacle, I saw the five hundred guests, I
saw Alma and my husband, and above all I saw my father, the old man
stricken with mortal maladies, the wounded lion whom the shadow of
death itself could not subdue, degraded to the dust in his hour of
pride by the act of his own child.</p>
<p>I heard his shouts of rage, his cries of fury, his imprecations
on me as one who should never touch a farthing of his fortune. And
then I heard the whispering of his "friends," who were telling the
"true story" of my disappearance, the tale of my "treacheries" to
my husband&mdash;just as if Satan had willed it that the only
result of the foolish f&ecirc;te on which my father had wasted his
wealth like water should be the publication of my shame.</p>
<p>But the bitterest part of my experience was still to come. In a
few minutes we sailed past the headlands of Port Raa, the lights of
my husband's house shot out of view like meteors on a murky night,
and the steamer turned her head to the open sea.</p>
<p>I was standing by a rope which crossed the bow and holding on to
it to save myself from falling, for, being alone with Nature at
last, I was seeing my flight for the first time in full light.</p>
<p>I was telling myself that as surely as my flight became known
Martin's name would be linked with mine, and the honour that was
dearer to me than, my own would be buried in disgrace.</p>
<p>O God! O God! Why should Nature be so hard and cruel to a woman?
Why should it be permitted that, having done no worse than obey the
purest impulses of my heart, the iron law of my sex should rise up
to condemn both me and the one who was dearer to my soul than life
itself?</p>
<p>I hardly know how long I stood there, holding on to that rope.
There was no sound now except the tread of a sailor in his heavy
boots, an inarticulate call from the bridge, an answering shout
from the wheel, the rattling of the wind in the rigging, the
throbbing of the engine in the bowels of the ship, and the
monotonous wash of the waves against her side.</p>
<p>Oh, how little I felt, how weak, how helpless!</p>
<p>I looked up towards the sky, but there seemed to be no sky, no
moon, and no stars, only a vaporous blackness that came down and
closed about me.</p>
<p>I looked out to the sea, but there seemed to be no sea, only a
hissing splash of green spray where the steamer's forward light
fell on the water which her bow was pitching up, and beyond that
nothing but a threatening and thundering void.</p>
<p>I did not weep, but I felt as other women had felt before me, as
other women have felt since, as women must always feel after they
have sinned against the world and the world's law, that there was
nothing before me but the blackness of night.</p>
<p>"Out of the depths I cry unto thee, O Lord. Lord, hear my
cry."</p>
<p>But all at once a blessed thought came to me. We were travelling
eastward, and dark as the night was now, in a few hours the day
would dawn, the sun would shine in our faces and the sky would
smile over our heads!</p>
<p>It would be like that with me. Martin would come back. I was
only going to meet him. It was dark midnight with me now, but I was
sailing into the sunrise!</p>
<p>Perhaps I was like a child, but I think that comforted me.</p>
<p>At all events I went down to the little triangular cabin with a
cheerful heart, forgetting that I was a runaway, a homeless
wanderer, an outcast, with nothing before me but the wilderness of
London where I should be friendless and alone.</p>
<p>The fire had gone out by this time, the oil-lamp was swinging to
the motion of the ship, the timbers were creaking, and the
Liverpool women were asleep.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="SEVENTY_NINTH_CHAPTER" id=
"SEVENTY_NINTH_CHAPTER"></a>SEVENTY-NINTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>At eight o'clock next morning I was in the train leaving
Liverpool for London.</p>
<p>I had selected a second-class compartment labelled "For Ladies,"
and my only travelling companion was a tall fair woman, in a
seal-skin coat and a very large black hat. She had filled the
carriage with the warm odour of eau-de-Cologne and the racks on
both sides with her luggage, which chiefly consisted of ladies' hat
boxes of various shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>Hardly had we started when I realised that she was a very
loquacious and expansive person.</p>
<p>Was I going all the way? Yes? Did I live in Liverpool? No? In
London perhaps? No? Probably I lived in the country? Yes? That was
charming, the country being so lovely.</p>
<p>I saw in a moment that if my flight was to be carried out to any
purpose I should have to conceal my identity; but how to do so I
did not know, my conscience never before having had to accuse me of
deliberate untruth.</p>
<p>Accident helped me. My companion asked me what was my husband's
profession, and being now accustomed to think of Martin as my real
husband, I answered that he was a commander.</p>
<p>"You mean the commander of a ship?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, you've been staying in Liverpool to see him off on a
voyage. How sweet! Just what I should do myself if my husband were
a sailor."</p>
<p>Then followed a further battery of perplexing questions.</p>
<p>Had my husband gone on a long voyage? Yes? Where to? The South.
Did I mean India, Australia, New Zealand? Yes, and still
farther.</p>
<p>"Ah, I see," she said again. "He's probably the captain of a
tramp steamer, and will go from port to port as long as he can find
a cargo."</p>
<p>Hardly understanding what my companion meant by this, I half
agreed to it, and then followed a volley of more personal
inquiries.</p>
<p>I was young to be married, wasn't I? Probably I hadn't been
married very long, had I? And not having settled myself in a home
perhaps I was going up to London to wait for my husband? Yes? How
wise&mdash;town being so much more cheerful than the country.</p>
<p>"Any friends there?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"None whatever?"</p>
<p>"None whatever."</p>
<p>"But won't you be lonely by yourself in London?"</p>
<p>"A little lonely perhaps."</p>
<p>Being satisfied that she had found out everything about me, my
travelling companion (probably from the mere love of talking) told
me something about herself.</p>
<p>She was a fashionable milliner and had a shop in the West End of
London. Occasionally she made personal visits to the provinces to
take orders from the leading shopkeepers, but during the season she
found it more profitable to remain in town, where her connection
was large, among people who could pay the highest prices.</p>
<p>By this time we had reached Crewe, and as there was some delay
in getting into the station, my travelling companion put her head
out of the window to inquire the cause. She was told that a night
train from Scotland was in front of us, and we should have to be
coupled on to it before we could proceed to London.</p>
<p>This threw her into the wildest state of excitement.</p>
<p>"I see what it is," she said. "The shooting season is over and
the society people are coming down from the moors. I know lots and
lots of them. They are my best customers&mdash;the gentlemen at all
events."</p>
<p>"The gentlemen?"</p>
<p>"Why, yes," she said with a little laugh.</p>
<p>After some shunting our Liverpool carriages were coupled to the
Scotch train and run into the station, where a number of gentlemen
in knickerbockers and cloth caps were strolling about the
platform.</p>
<p>My companion seemed to know them all, and gave them their names,
generally their Christian names, and often their familiar ones.</p>
<p>Suddenly I had a shock. A tall man, whose figure I recognised,
passed close by our carriage, and I had only time to conceal myself
from observation behind the curtain of the window.</p>
<p>"Helloa!" cried my companion. "There's Teddy Eastcliff. He
married Camilla, the Russian dancer. They first met in my shop I
may tell you."</p>
<p>I was feeling hot and cold by turns, but a thick veil must have
hidden my confusion, for after we left Crewe my companion, becoming
still more confidential, talked for a long time about her
aristocratic customers, and I caught a glimpse of a life that was
on the verge of a kind of fashionable Bohemia.</p>
<p>More than once I recognised my husband's friends among the
number of her clients, and trembling lest my husband himself should
become a subject of discussion, I, made the excuse of a headache to
close my eyes and be silent.</p>
<p>My companion thereupon slept, very soundly and rather audibly,
from Rugby to Willesden, where, awakening with a start while the
tickets were being collected, she first powdered her face by her
fashion-glass and then interested herself afresh in my affairs.</p>
<p>"Did you say, my dear, that you have no friends in London?"</p>
<p>I repeated that I had none.</p>
<p>"Then you will go to an hotel, I suppose?"</p>
<p>I answered that I should have to look for something less
expensive.</p>
<p>"In that case," she said, "I think I know something that will
suit you exactly."</p>
<p>It was a quiet boarding establishment in
Bloomsbury&mdash;comfortable house, reasonable terms, and, above
all, perfectly respectable. In fact, it was kept by her own sister,
and if I liked she would take me along in her cab and drop me at
the door. Should she?</p>
<p>Looking back at that moment I cannot but wonder that after what
I had heard I did not fear discovery. But during the silence of the
last hour I had been feeling more than ever weak and helpless, so
that when my companion offered me a shelter in that great, noisy,
bewildering city in which I had intended to hide myself, but now
feared I might be submerged and lost, with a willing if not a
cheerful heart I accepted.</p>
<p>Half an hour afterwards our cab drew up in a street off Russell
Square at a rather grimy-looking house which stood at the corner of
another and smaller square that was shut off by an iron
railing.</p>
<p>The door was opened by a young waiter of sixteen or seventeen
years, who was wearing a greasy dress-suit and a soiled shirt
front.</p>
<p>My companion pushed into the hall, I followed her, and almost at
the same moment a still larger and perhaps grosser woman than my
friend, with the same features and complexion, came out of a room
to the left with, a serviette in her hand.</p>
<p>"Sophie!"</p>
<p>"Jane!" cried my companion, and pointing to me she said:</p>
<p>"I've brought you a new boarder."</p>
<p>Then followed a rapid account of where she had met me, who and
what I was, and why I had come up to London.</p>
<p>"I've promised you'll take her in and not charge her too much,
you know."</p>
<p>"Why, no, certainly not," said the sister.</p>
<p>At the next moment the boy waiter was bringing, my trunk into
the house on his shoulder and my travelling companion was bidding
me good-bye and saying she would look me up later.</p>
<p>When the door was closed I found the house full of the smell of
hot food, chiefly roast beef and green vegetables, and I could hear
the clink of knives and forks and the clatter of dishes in the room
the landlady had come from.</p>
<p>"You'd like to go up to your bedroom at once, wouldn't you?" she
said.</p>
<p>We went up two flights of stairs covered with rather dirty
druggeting, along a corridor that had a thin strip of linoleum, and
finally up a third flight that was bare to the boards, until we
came to a room which seemed to be at the top of the house and
situated in its remotest corner.</p>
<p>It was a very small apartment, hardly larger than the room over
the hall at home in which Aunt Bridget had made me sleep when I was
a child, and it was nearly as cold and cheerless.</p>
<p>The wall-paper, which had once been a flowery pink, was now pale
and patternless; the Venetian blind over the window (which looked
out on the smaller square) had lost one of its cords and hung at an
irregular angle; there was a mirror over the mantelpiece with the
silvering much mottled, and a leather-covered easy chair whereof
the spring was broken and the seat heavily indented.</p>
<p>"I dare say this will do for the present," said my landlady, and
though my heart was in my mouth I compelled myself to agree.</p>
<p>"My terms, including meals and all extras, will be a pound a
week," she added, and to that also, with a lump in my throat I
assented, whereupon my landlady left me, saying luncheon was on and
I could come downstairs when I was ready.</p>
<p>A talkative cockney chambermaid, with a good little face,
brought me a fat blue jug of hot water, and after I had washed and
combed I found my way down to the dining-room.</p>
<p>What I expected to find there I hardly know. What I did find was
a large chamber, as dingy as the rest of the house, and as much in
need of refreshing, with a long table down the middle, at which
some twenty persons sat eating, with the landlady presiding at the
top.</p>
<p>The company, who were of both sexes and chiefly elderly, seemed
to me at that first sight to be dressed in every variety of
out-of-date clothes, many of them rather shabby and some almost
grotesque.</p>
<p>Raising their faces from their plates they looked at me as I
entered, and I was so confused that I stood hesitating near the
door until the landlady called to me.</p>
<p>"Come up here," she said, and when I had done so, and taken the
seat by her side, which had evidently been reserved for me, she
whispered:</p>
<p>"I don't think my sister mentioned your name, my dear. What is
it?"</p>
<p>I had no time to deliberate.</p>
<p>"O'Neill," I whispered back, and thereupon my landlady, raising
her voice, and addressing the company as if they had been members
of her family, said:</p>
<p>"Mrs. O'Neill, my dears."</p>
<p>Then the ladies at the table inclined their heads at me and
smiled, while the men (especially those who were the most strangely
dressed) rose from their seats and bowed deeply.</p>

<h2><a name="EIGHTIETH_CHAPTER" id=
"EIGHTIETH_CHAPTER"></a>EIGHTIETH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Of all houses in London this, I thought, was the least suitable
to me.</p>
<p>Looking down the table I told myself that it must be the very
home of idle gossip and the hot-bed of tittle-tattle.</p>
<p>I was wrong. Hardly had I been in the house a day when I
realised that my fellow-guests were the most reserved and
self-centred of all possible people.</p>
<p>One old gentleman who wore a heavy moustache, and had been a
colonel in the Indian army, was understood to be a student of
Biblical prophecy, having collected some thousands of texts which
established the identity of the British nation with the lost tribes
of Israel.</p>
<p>Another old gentleman, who wore a patriarchal beard and had
taken orders without securing a living, was believed to be writing
a history of the world and (after forty years of continuous labour)
to have reached the century before Christ.</p>
<p>An elderly lady with a benign expression was said to be a tragic
actress who was studying in secret for a season at the National
Theatre.</p>
<p>Such, and of such kind, were my house-mates; and I have since
been told that every great city has many such groups of people, the
great prophets, the great historians, the great authors, the great
actors whom the world does not know&mdash;the odds and ends of
humanity, thrown aside by the rushing river of life into the
gulley-ways that line its banks, the odd brothers, the odd sisters,
the odd uncles, the odd aunts, for whom there is no place in the
family, in society, or in the business of the world.</p>
<p>It was all very curious and pathetic, yet I think I should have
been safe, for a time at all events, in this little corner of
London into which chance had so strangely thrown me, but for one
unfortunate happening.</p>
<p>That was the arrival of the daily newspaper.</p>
<p>There was never more than a single copy. It came at eight in the
morning and was laid on the dining-room mantelpiece, from which (by
an unwritten law of the house) it was the duty as well as the
honour of the person who had first finished breakfast to take it up
and read the most startling part of the news to the rest of the
company.</p>
<p>Thus it occurred that on the third morning after my arrival I
was startled by the voice of the old colonel, who, standing back to
the fire, with the newspaper in his hand, cried:</p>
<p>"Mysterious Disappearance of a Peeress."</p>
<p>"Read it," said the old clergyman.</p>
<p>The tea-cup which I was raising to my mouth trembled in my hand,
and when I set it down it rattled against the saucer. I knew what
was coming, and it came.</p>
<p>The old colonel read:</p>
<p>"<i>A telegram from Blackwater announces the mysterious
disappearance of the young wife of Lord Raa, which appears to have
taken place late on Thursday night or in the early hours of Friday
morning</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>It will be remembered that the missing lady was married a
little more than a year ago, and her disappearance is the more
unaccountable from the fact that during the past month she has been
actively occupied in preparing for a f&ecirc;te in honour of her
return home after a long and happy honeymoon</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>The pavilion in which the f&ecirc;te was to have been held
had been erected on a headland between Castle Raa and a precipitous
declivity to the sea, and the only reasonable conjecture is that
the unhappy lady, going out on Thursday night to superintend the
final preparations, lost her way in the darkness and fell over the
cliffs</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>The fact that the hostess was missing was not generally
known in Ellan until the guests had begun to arrive for the
reception on Friday evening, when the large assembly broke up in
great confusion</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Naturally much sympathy is felt for the grief-stricken
husband</i>."</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>After the colonel had finished reading I had an almost
irresistible impulse to scream, feeling sure that the moment my
house-mates looked into my face they must see that I was the person
indicated.</p>
<p>They did not look, and after a chorus of exclamations ("Most
mysterious!" "What can have become of her?" "On the eve of her
f&ecirc;te too!") they began to discuss disappearances in general,
each illustrating his point by reference to the subject of his own
study.</p>
<p>"Perfectly extraordinary how people disappear nowadays," said
one.</p>
<p>"Extraordinary, sir?" said the old colonel, looking over his
spectacles, "why should it be extraordinary that one person should
disappear when whole nations&mdash;the ten tribes for example. . .
."</p>
<p>"But that's a different thing altogether," said the old
clergyman. "Now if you had quoted Biblical examples&mdash;Elisha or
perhaps Jonah. . . ."</p>
<p>After the discussion had gone on for several minutes in this way
I rose from the table on my trembling limbs and slipped out of the
room.</p>
<p>It would take long to tell of the feverish days that
followed&mdash;how newspaper correspondents were sent from London
to Ellan to inquire into the circumstances of my disappearance; how
the theory of accident gave place to the theory of suicide, and the
theory of suicide to the theory of flight; how a porter on the pier
at Blackwater said he had carried my trunk to the steamer that
sailed on Thursday midnight, thinking I was a maid from the great
house until I had given him half-a-crown (his proper fee being
threepence); how two female passengers had declared that a person
answering to my description had sailed with them to Liverpool; how
these clues had been followed up and had led to nothing; and how,
finally, the correspondents had concluded the whole incident of my
disappearance could not be more mysterious if I had been dropped
from mid-air into the middle of the Irish Sea.</p>
<p>But then came another development.</p>
<p>My father, who was reported to have received the news of my
departure in a way that suggested he had lost control of his senses
(raging and storming at my husband like a man demented), having
come to the conclusion that I, being in a physical condition
peculiar to women, had received a serious shock resulting in a loss
of memory, offered five hundred pounds reward for information that
would lead to my discovery, which was not only desirable to allay
the distress of my heart-broken family but urgently necessary to
settle important questions of title and inheritance.</p>
<p>With this offer of a reward came a description of my personal
appearance.</p>
<p><i>"Age 20, a little under medium height; slight; very black
hair; lustrous dark eyes; regular features; pale face; grave
expression; unusually sunny smile."</i></p>
<p>It would be impossible for me to say with what perturbation I
heard these reports read out by the old colonel and the old
clergyman. Even the nervous stirring of my spoon and the agitated
clatter of my knife and fork made me wonder that my house-mates did
not realise the truth, which must I thought, be plainly evident to
all eyes.</p>
<p>They never did, being so utterly immersed in their own theories.
But all the same I sometimes felt as if my fellow guests in that
dingy house in Bloomsbury were my judges and jury, and more than
once, in my great agitation, when the reports came near to the
truth, I wanted to cry. "Stop, stop, don't you see it is I?"</p>
<p>That I never did so was due to the fact that, not knowing what
legal powers my father might have to compel my return to Ellan, the
terror that sat on me like a nightmare was that of being made the
subject of a public quarrel between my father and my husband,
concerning the legitimacy of my unborn child, with the shame and
disgrace which that would bring not only upon me but upon
Martin.</p>
<p>I had some reason for this fear.</p>
<p>After my father's offer of a reward there came various spiteful
paragraphs (inspired, as I thought, by Alma and written by the
clumsier hand of my husband) saying it was reported in Ellan that,
if my disappearance was to be accounted for on the basis of flight,
the only "shock" I could have experienced must be a shock of
conscience, rumour having for some time associated my name with
that of a person who was not unknown in connection with Antarctic
exploration.</p>
<p>It was terrible.</p>
<p>Day by day the motive of my disappearance became the sole topic
of conversation in our boarding-house. I think the landlady must
have provided an evening as well as a morning paper, for at tea in
the drawing-room upstairs the most recent reports were always being
discussed.</p>
<p>After a while I realised that not only my house-mates but all
London was discussing my disappearance.</p>
<p>It was a rule of our boarding-house that during certain hours of
the day everybody should go out as if he had business to go to, and
having nothing else to do I used to walk up and down the streets.
In doing so I was compelled to pass certain newsvendors' stalls,
and I saw for several days that nearly every placard had something
about "the missing peeress."</p>
<p>When this occurred I would walk quickly along the thoroughfare
with a sense of being pursued and the feeling which a nervous woman
has when she is going down a dark corridor at night&mdash;that
noiseless footsteps are coming behind, and a hand may at any moment
be laid on her shoulder.</p>
<p>But nobody troubled me in the streets and the only person in our
boarding-house who seemed to suspect me was our landlady. She said
nothing, but when my lip was quivering while the old colonel read
that cruel word about Martin I caught her little grey eyes looking
aslant at me.</p>
<p>One afternoon, her sister, the milliner, came to see me
according to her promise, and though she, too, said nothing, I saw
that, while the old colonel and the old clergyman were disputing on
the hearthrug about some disappearance which occurred thousands of
years ago, she was looking fixedly at the fingers with which, in my
nervousness, I was ruckling up the discoloured chintz of my
chair.</p>
<p>Then in a moment&mdash;I don't know why&mdash;it flashed upon me
that my travelling companion was in correspondence with my
father.</p>
<p>That idea became so insistent towards dinner-time that I made
pretence of being ill (which was not very difficult) to retire to
my room, where the cockney chambermaid wrung handkerchiefs out of
vinegar and laid them on my forehead to relieve my
headache&mdash;though she increased it, poor thing, by talking
perpetually.</p>
<p>Next morning the landlady came up to say that if, as she assumed
from my name, I was Irish and a Catholic, I might like to receive a
visit from a Sister of Mercy who called at the house at intervals
to attend to the sick.</p>
<p>I thought I saw in a moment that this was a subterfuge, but
feeling that my identity was suspected I dared not give cause for
further suspicion, so I compelled myself to agree.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, having got up and dressed, I was standing
with my back to the window, feeling like one who would soon have to
face an attack, when a soft footstep came up my corridor and a
gentle hand knocked at my door.</p>
<p>"Come in," I cried, trembling like the last leaf at the end of a
swinging bough.</p>
<p>And then an astonishing thing happened.</p>
<p>A young woman stepped quietly into the room and closed the door
behind her. She was wearing the black and white habit of the Little
Sisters of the Poor, but I knew her long, pale, plain-featured face
in an instant.</p>
<p>A flood of shame, and at the same time a flood of joy swept over
me at the sight of her.</p>
<p>It was Mildred Bankes.</p>

<h2><a name="EIGHTY_FIRST_CHAPTER" id=
"EIGHTY_FIRST_CHAPTER"></a>EIGHTY-FIRST CHAPTER</h2>
<p>"Mary," said Mildred, "speak low and tell me everything."</p>
<p>She sat in my chair, I knelt by her side, took one of her hands
in both of mine, and told her.</p>
<p>I told her that I had fled from my husband's house because I
could not bear to remain there any longer.</p>
<p>I told her that my father had married me against my will, in
spite of my protests, when I was a child, and did not know that I
had any right to resist him.</p>
<p>I told her that my father&mdash;God forgive me if I did him a
wrong&mdash;did not love me, that he had sacrificed my happiness to
his lust of power, and that if he were searching for me now it was
only because my absence disturbed his plans and hurt his pride.</p>
<p>I told her that my husband did not love me either, and that he
had married me from the basest motives, merely to pay his debts and
secure an income.</p>
<p>I told her, too, that not only did my husband not love me, but
he loved somebody else, that he had been cruel and brutal to me,
and therefore (for these and other reasons) I could not return to
him under any circumstances.</p>
<p>While I was speaking I felt Mildred's hand twitching between
mine, and when I had finished she said:</p>
<p>"But, my dear child, they told me your friends were
broken-hearted about you; that you had lost your memory and perhaps
your reason, and therefore it would be a good act to help them to
send you home."</p>
<p>"It's not true, it's not true," I said.</p>
<p>And then in a low voice, as if afraid of being overheard, she
told me how she came to be there&mdash;that the woman who had
travelled with me in the train from Liverpool, seeing my father's
offer of a reward, had written to him to say that she knew where I
was and only needed somebody to establish my identity; that my
father wished to come to London for this purpose, but had been
forbidden by his doctor; that our parish priest, Father Donovan,
had volunteered to come instead, but had been prohibited by his
Bishop; and finally that my father had written to his lawyers in
London, and Father Dan to her, knowing that she and I had been
together at the Sacred Heart in Rome, and that it was her work now
to look after lost ones and send them safely back to their
people.</p>
<p>"And now the lawyer and the doctors are downstairs," she said in
a whisper, "and they are only waiting for me to say who you are
that they may apply for an order to send you home."</p>
<p>This terrified me so much that I made a fervent appeal to
Mildred to save me.</p>
<p>"Oh, Mildred, save me, save me," I cried.</p>
<p>"But how can I? how can I?" she asked.</p>
<p>I saw what she meant, and thinking to touch her still more
deeply I told her the rest of my story.</p>
<p>I told her that if I had fled from my husband's house it was not
merely because he had been cruel and brutal to me, but because I,
too, loved somebody else&mdash;somebody who was far away but was
coming back, and there was nothing I could not bear for him in the
meantime, no pain or suffering or loneliness, and when he returned
he would protect me from every danger, and we should love each
other eternally.</p>
<p>If I had not been so wildly agitated I should have known that
this was the wrong way with Mildred, and it was not until I had
said it all in a rush of whispered words that I saw her eyes fixed
on me as if they were about to start from their sockets.</p>
<p>"But, my dear, dear child," she said, "this is worse and worse.
Your father and your husband may have done wrong, but you have done
wrong too. Don't you see you have?"</p>
<p>I did not tell her that I had thought of all that before, and
did not believe any longer that God would punish me for breaking a
bond I had been forced to make. But when she was about to rise,
saying that after all it would be a good thing to send me home
before I had time to join my life to his&mdash;whoever he
was&mdash;who had led me to forget my duty as a wife, I held her
trembling hands and whispered:</p>
<p>"Wait, Mildred. There is something I have not told you even
yet."</p>
<p>"What is it?" she asked, but already I could see that she knew
what I was going to say.</p>
<p>"Mildred," I said, "if I ran away from my husband it was not
merely because I loved somebody else, but because. . . ."</p>
<p>I could not say it. Do what I would I could not. But holy women
like Mildred, who spend their lives among the lost ones, have a way
of reading a woman's heart when it is in trouble, and Mildred read
mine.</p>
<p>"Do you mean that . . . that there are consequences . . . going
to be?" she whispered.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Does your husband know?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And your father?"</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Mildred drew her hand away from me and crossed herself, saying
beneath her breath:</p>
<p>"Oh Mother of my God!"</p>
<p>I felt more humbled than I had ever been before, but after a
while I said:</p>
<p>"Now you see why I can never go back. And you will save me, will
you not?"</p>
<p>There was silence for some moments. Mildred had drawn back in
her chair as if an evil spirit had passed between us But at length
she said:</p>
<p>"It is not for me to judge you, Mary. But the gentlemen will
come up soon to know if you are the Mary O'Neill whom I knew at the
Sacred Heart, and what am I to say to them?"</p>
<p>"Say no," I cried. "Why shouldn't you? They'll never know
anything to the contrary. Nobody will know."</p>
<p>"Nobody?"</p>
<p>I knew what Mildred meant, and in my shame and confusion I tried
to excuse myself by telling her who the other woman was.</p>
<p>"It is Alma," I said.</p>
<p>"Alma? Alma Lier?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>And then I told her how Alma had come back into my life, how she
had tortured and tempted me, and was now trying to persuade my
husband, who was a Protestant, to divorce me that she might take my
place.</p>
<p>And then I spoke of Martin again&mdash;I could not help
it&mdash;saying that the shame which Alma would bring on him would
be a greater grief to me than anything else that could befall me in
this world.</p>
<p>"If you only knew who he is," I said, "and the honour he is held
in, you would know that I would rather die a thousand deaths than
that any disgrace should fall on him through me."</p>
<p>I could see that Mildred was deeply moved at this, and though I
did not intend to play upon her feelings, yet in the selfishness of
my great love I could not help doing so.</p>
<p>"You were the first of my girl friends, Mildred&mdash;the very
first. Don't you remember the morning after I arrived at school?
They had torn me away from my mother, and I was so little and
lonely, but you were so sweet and kind. You took me into church for
my first visitation, and then into the garden for my first
rosary&mdash;don't you remember it?"</p>
<p>Mildred had closed her eyes. Her face was becoming very
white.</p>
<p>"And then don't you remember the day the news came that my
mother was very ill, and I was to go home? You came to see me off
at the station, and don't you remember what you said when we were
sitting in the train? You said we might never meet again, because
our circumstances would be so different. You didn't think we should
meet like this, did you?"</p>
<p>Mildred's face was growing deadly white.</p>
<p>"My darling mother died. She was all I had in the world and I
was all she had, and when she was gone there was no place for me in
my father's house, so I was sent back to school. But the Reverend
Mother was very kind to me, and the end of it was that I wished to
become a nun. Yes indeed, and never so much as on the day you took
your vows."</p>
<p>Mildred's eyes were still closed, but her eyelids were
fluttering and she was breathing audibly.</p>
<p>"How well I remember it! The sweet summer morning and the
snow-white sunshine, and the white flowers and the white chapel of
the Little Sisters, and then you dressed as a bride in your white
gown and long white veil. I cried all through the ceremony. And if
my father had not come for me then, perhaps I should have been a
nun like you now."</p>
<p>Mildred's lips were moving. I was sure she was praying to our
Lady for strength to resist my pleading, yet that only made me
plead the harder.</p>
<p>"But God knows best what our hearts are made for," I said. "He
knows that mine was made for love. And though you may not think it
I know God knows that he who is away is my real husband&mdash;not
the one they married me to. You will not separate us, will you? All
our happiness&mdash;his and mine&mdash;is in your hands. You will
save us, will you not?"</p>
<p>Some time passed before Mildred spoke. It may have been only a
few moments, but to me it seemed like an eternity. I did not know
then that Mildred was reluctant to extinguish the last spark of
hope in me. At length she said:</p>
<p>"Mary, you don't know what you are asking me to do. When I took
my vows I promised to speak the truth under all circumstances, no
matter what the consequences, as surely as I should answer to God
at the great Day of Judgment. Yet you wish me to lie. How can I?
How can I? Remember my vows, my duty."</p>
<p>I think the next few minutes must have been the most evil of all
my life. When I saw, or thought I saw, that, though one word would
save me, one little word, Mildred intended to give me away to the
men downstairs, I leapt to my feet and burst out on her with the
bitterest reproaches.</p>
<p>"You religious women are always talking about your duty," I
cried. "You never think about love. Love is kind and merciful; but
no, duty, always duty! Love indeed! What do you cold creatures out
of the convent, with your crosses and rosaries, know about
love&mdash;real love&mdash;the blazing fire in a woman's heart when
she loves somebody so much that she would give her heart's blood
for him&mdash;yes, and her soul itself if need be."</p>
<p>What else I said I cannot remember, for I did not know what I
was doing until I found myself looking out of the window and
panting for breath.</p>
<p>Then I became aware that Mildred was making no reply to my
reproaches, and looking over my shoulder I saw that she was still
sitting in my chair with both her hands covering her face and the
tears trickling through her fingers on to the linen of her
habit.</p>
<p>That conquered me in a moment.</p>
<p>I was seized with such remorse that I wished to throw my arms
about her neck and kiss her. I dared not do that, now, but I knelt
by her side again and asked her to forgive me.</p>
<p>"Forgive me, sister," I said. "I see now that God has brought us
to this pass and there is no way out of it. You must do what you
think is right. I shall always know you couldn't have done
otherwise. <i>He</i> will know too. And if it must be that disgrace
is to fall on him through me . . . and that when he comes home he
will find. . . ."</p>
<p>But I could not bear to speak about that, so I dropped my head
on Mildred's lap.</p>
<p>During the silence that followed we heard the sound of footsteps
coming up the stairs.</p>
<p>"Listen! They're here," said Mildred. "Get up. Say nothing.
Leave everything to me."</p>
<p>I rose quickly and returned to the window. Mildred dried her
eyes, got up from the chair and stood with her back to the
fire-place.</p>
<p>There was a knock at my door. I do not know which of us answered
it, but my landlady came into the room, followed by three men in
tall silk hats.</p>
<p>"Excuse us, my dear," she said, in an insincere voice. "These
gentlemen are making an examination of the house, and they wish to
see your room. May they?"</p>
<p>I do not think I made any reply. I was holding my breath and
watching intently. The men made a pretence of glancing round, but I
could see they were looking at Mildred. Their looks seemed to say
as plainly as words could speak:</p>
<p>"Is it she?"</p>
<p>Mildred hesitated for a moment, there was a dreadful silence and
then&mdash;may the holy Virgin bless her!&mdash;she shook her
head.</p>
<p>I could bear no more. I turned back to the window. The men, who
had looked at each other with expressions of surprise, tried to
talk together in ordinary tones as if on common place subjects.</p>
<p>"So there's nothing to do here, apparently."</p>
<p>"Apparently not."</p>
<p>"Let's go, then. Good day, Sister. Sorry to have troubled
you."</p>
<p>I heard the door close behind them. I heard their low voices as
they passed along the corridor. I heard their slow footsteps as
they went down the stairs. And then, feeling as if my heart would
burst, I turned to throw myself at Sister Mildred's feet.</p>
<p>But Sister Mildred was on her knees, with her face buried in my
bed, praying fervently.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="EIGHTY_SECOND_CHAPTER" id=
"EIGHTY_SECOND_CHAPTER"></a>EIGHTY-SECOND CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I did not know then, and it seems unnecessary to say now, why my
father gave up the search for me in London. He did so, and from the
day the milliner's clue failed him I moved about freely.</p>
<p>Then from the sense of being watched I passed into that of being
lost.</p>
<p>Sister Mildred was my only friend in London, but she was
practically cut off from me. The Little Sisters had fixed her up
(in the interests of her work among the lost ones) in a tiny flat
at the top of a lofty building near Piccadilly, where her lighted
window always reminded me of a lighthouse on the edge of a
dangerous reef. But in giving me her address she warned me not to
come to her except in case of urgent need partly because further
intercourse might discredit her denial, and partly because it would
not be good for me to be called "one of Sister Veronica's
girls"&mdash;that being Mildred's name as a nun.</p>
<p>Oh the awful loneliness of London!</p>
<p>Others just as friendless have wandered in the streets of the
big city. I knew I was not the first, and I am sure I have not been
the last to find London the most solitary place in the world. But I
really and truly think there was one day of the week when, from
causes peculiar to my situation, my loneliness must have been
deeper than that of the most friendless refugee.</p>
<p>Nearly every boarder in our boarding-house used to receive once
a week or once a month a letter containing a remittance from some
unknown source, with which he paid his landlady and discharged his
other obligations.</p>
<p>I had no such letter to receive, so to keep up the character I
had not made but allowed myself to maintain (of being a commander's
wife) I used to go out once a week under pretence of calling at a
shipping office to draw part of my husband's pay.</p>
<p>In my childish ignorance of the habits of business people I
selected Saturday afternoon for this purpose; and in my fear of
encountering my husband, or my husband's friends in the West End
streets, I chose the less conspicuous thoroughfares at the other
side of the river.</p>
<p>Oh, the wearisome walks I had on Saturday afternoons, wet or
dry, down the Seven Dials, across Trafalgar Square, along
Whitehall, round the eastern end of the Houses of Parliament, and
past Westminster Pier (dear to me from one poignant memory), and so
on and on into the monotonous and inconspicuous streets beyond.</p>
<p>Towards nightfall I would return, generally by the footway
across Hungerford Bridge, which is thereby associated with the most
painful moments of my life, for nowhere else did I feel quite so
helpless and so lonely.</p>
<p>The trains out of Charing Cross shrieking past me, the dark
river flowing beneath, the steamers whistling under the bridge, the
automobiles tooting along the Embankment, the clanging of the
electric cars, the arc lamps burning over the hotels and the open
flares blazing over the theatres&mdash;all the never-resting life
of London&mdash;and myself in the midst of the tumultuous solitude,
a friendless and homeless girl.</p>
<p>But God in His mercy saved me from all that&mdash;saved me too,
in ways in which it was only possible to save a woman.</p>
<p>The first way was through my vanity.</p>
<p>Glancing at myself in my mottled mirror one morning I was
shocked to see that what with my loneliness and my weary walks I
was losing my looks, for my cheeks were hollow, my nose was
pinched, my eyes were heavy with dark rings underneath them, and I
was plainer than Martin had ever seen me.</p>
<p>This frightened me.</p>
<p>It would be ridiculous to tell all the foolish things I did
after that to improve and preserve my appearance for Martin's sake,
because every girl whose sweetheart is away knows quite well, and
it is not important that anybody else should.</p>
<p>There was a florist's shop in Southampton Row, and I went there
every morning for a little flower which I wore in the breast of my
bodice, making believe to myself that Martin had given it to
me.</p>
<p>There was a jeweller's shop there too, and I sold my wedding
ring (having long felt as if it burnt my finger) and bought another
wedding ring with an inscription on the inside "<i>From Martin to
Mary</i>."</p>
<p>As a result of all this caressing of myself I saw after a while,
to my great joy, that my good looks were coming back; and it would
be silly to say what a thrill of delight I had when, going into the
drawing-room of our boarding-house one day, the old actress called
me "Beauty" instead of the name I had hitherto been known by.</p>
<p>The second way in which God saved me from my loneliness was
through my condition.</p>
<p>I did not yet know what angel was whispering to me out of the
physical phase I was passing through, when suddenly I became
possessed by a passion for children.</p>
<p>It was just as if a whole new world of humanity sprang into life
for me by magic. When I went out for my walks in the streets I
ceased to be conscious of the faces of men and women, and it seemed
as if London were peopled by children only.</p>
<p>I saw no more of the crowds going their different ways like ants
on an ant-hill, but I could not let a perambulator pass without
peering under the lace of the hood at the little cherub face whose
angel eyes looked up at me.</p>
<p>There was an asylum for children suffering from incurable
diseases in the smaller square beside our boarding-house, and every
morning after breakfast, no matter how cold the day might be, I
would open my window to hear the cheerful voices of the suffering
darlings singing their hymn:</p>
<p>"<i>There's a Friend for little children,<br />
Above the bright blue sky</i>."</p>
<p>Thus six weeks passed, Christmas approached, and the sad old
city began to look glad and young and gay.</p>
<p>Since a certain night at Castle Raa I had had a vague feeling
that I had thrown myself out of the pale of the Church, therefore I
had never gone to service since I came to London, and had almost
forgotten that confession and the mass used to be sweet to me.</p>
<p>But going home one evening in the deepening London fog (for the
weather had begun to be frosty) I saw, through the open doors of a
Catholic church, a great many lights in a side chapel, and found
they were from a little illuminated model of the Nativity with the
Virgin and Child in the stable among the straw. A group of untidy
children were looking at it with bright beady eyes and chattering
under their breath, while a black-robed janitor was rattling his
keys to make them behave.</p>
<p>This brought back the memory of Rome and of Sister Angela. But
it also made me think of Martin, and remember his speech at the
public dinner, about saying the prayers for the day with his
comrades, that they might feel that they were not cut off from the
company of Christian men.</p>
<p>So telling myself he must be back by this time on that lonely
plateau that guards the Pole, I resolved (without thinking of the
difference of time) to go to mass on Christmas morning, in order to
be doing the same thing as Martin at the same moment.</p>
<p>With this in my mind I returned to our boarding-house and found
Christmas there too, for on looking into the drawing-room on my way
upstairs I saw the old actress, standing on a chair, hanging holly
which the old colonel with old-fashioned courtesy was handing up to
her.</p>
<p>They were cackling away like two old hens when they caught sight
of me, whereupon the old actress cried:</p>
<p>"Ah, here's Beauty!"</p>
<p>Then she asked me if I would like a ticket for a dress rehearsal
on Christmas Eve of a Christmas pantomime.</p>
<p>"The audience will be chiefly children out of the lanes and
alleys round about, but perhaps you won't mind that," she said.</p>
<p>I told her I should be overjoyed, and at two o'clock the
following afternoon I was in my seat at the corner of the
dress-circle of the great theatre, from which I could see both the
stage and the auditorium.</p>
<p>The vast place was packed with children from ceiling to floor,
and I could see the invisible hands of thousands of mothers who had
put the girls into clean pinafores and brushed and oiled the
tousled heads of the boys.</p>
<p>How their eager faces glistened! How sad they looked when the
wicked sisters left Cinderella alone in the kitchen! How bright
when the glittering fairy godmother came to visit her! How their
little dangling feet clapped together with joy when the pretty maid
went off to the ball behind six little ponies which pranced along
under the magical moonlight in the falling snow!</p>
<p>But the part of the performance which they liked best was their
own part when, in the interval, the band struck up one of the songs
they sang in their lanes and alleys:</p>
<p>"<i>Yew aw the enny, Oi em ther bee,<br />
Oi'd like ter sip ther enny from those red lips yew see</i>."</p>
<p>That was so loaded with the memory of one of the happiest days
of my life (the day I went with Martin to see the <i>Scotia</i>)
that, in the yearning of the motherhood still unborn in me, I felt
as if I should like to gather the whole screaming houseful of happy
children to my breast.</p>
<p>But oh why, why, why, does not Providence warn us when we are on
the edge of tragic things?</p>
<p>The pantomime rehearsal being over I was hurrying home (for the
evening was cold, though I was so warm within) when I became aware
of a number of newsmen who were flying up from the direction of the
Strand, crying their papers at the top of their voice.</p>
<p>I did not usually listen to such people, but I was compelled to
do so now, for they were all around me.</p>
<p>"<i>Paper&mdash;third e'shen&mdash;loss of the Sco-sha</i>."</p>
<p>The cry fell on me like a thunderbolt. An indescribable terror
seized me. I felt paralysed and stood dead still. People were
buying copies of the papers, and at first I made a feeble effort to
do the same. But my voice was faint; the newsman did not hear me
and he went flying past.</p>
<p>"<i>Paper&mdash;third e'shen&mdash;reported loss of the
Sco-sha</i>."</p>
<p>After that I dared not ask for a paper. Literally I dared not. I
dared not know the truth. I dared not see the dreadful fact in
print.</p>
<p>So I began to hurry home. But as I passed through the streets,
stunned, stupefied, perspiring, feeling as if I were running away
from some malignant curse, the newsmen seemed to be pursuing me,
for they were darting out from every street.</p>
<p>"<i>Paper&mdash;third e'shen&mdash;loss of the Sco-sha</i>."</p>
<p>Faster and faster I hurried along. But the awful cry was always
ringing in my ears, behind, before, and on either side.</p>
<p>When I reached our boarding-house my limbs could scarcely
support me. I had hardly strength enough to pull the bell. And
before our young waiter had opened the door two news men, crossing
the square, were crying:</p>

<p>As I passed through the hall the old colonel and the old
clergyman were standing by the dining-room door. They were talking
excitedly, and while I was going upstairs, panting hard and holding
on by the handrail, I heard part of their conversation.</p>
<p>"Scotia was the name of the South Pole ship, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>"Certainly it was. We must send young John out for a paper."</p>
<p>Reaching my room I dropped into my chair. My faculties had so
failed me that for some minutes I was unable to think. Presently my
tired brain recalled the word "Reported" and to that my last hope
began to cling as a drowning sailor clings to a drifting spar.</p>
<p>After a while I heard some of our boarders talking on the floor
below. Opening my door and listening eagerly I heard one of them
say, in such a casual tone:</p>
<p>"Rather sad&mdash;this South Pole business, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, if it's true."</p>
<p>"Doesn't seem much doubt about that&mdash;unless there are two
ships of the same name, you know."</p>
<p>At that my heart leapt up. I had now two rafts to cling to. Just
then the gong sounded, and my anxiety compelled me to go down to
tea.</p>
<p>As I entered the drawing-room the old colonel was unfolding a
newspaper.</p>
<p>"Here we are," he was saying. "Reported loss of the
<i>Scotia</i>&mdash;Appalling Antarctic Calamity."</p>
<p>I tried to slide into the seat nearest to the door, but the old
actress made room for me on the sofa close to the tea-table.</p>
<p>"You enjoyed the rehearsal? Yes?" she whispered.</p>
<p>"Hush!" said our landlady, handing me a cup of tea, and then the
old colonel, standing back to the fire, began to read.</p>
<p>"<i>Telegrams from New Zealand report the picking up of large
fragments of a ship which were floating from the Antarctic seas.
Among them were the bulwarks, some portions of the deck cargo, and
the stern of a boat, bearing the name 'Scotia.'</i></p>
<p>"<i>Grave fears are entertained that these fragments belong to
the schooner of the South Pole expedition, which left Akaroa a few
weeks ago, and the character of some of the remnants (being vital
parts of a ship's structure) lead to the inference that the vessel
herself must have foundered</i>."</p>
<p>"Well, well," said the old clergyman, with his mouth full of
buttered toast.</p>
<p>The walls of the room seemed to be moving around me. I could
scarcely see; I could scarcely hear.</p>
<p>"<i>Naturally there can be no absolute certainty that the
'Scotia' may not be still afloat, or that the members of the
expedition may not have reached a place of safety, but the presence
of large pieces of ice attached to some of the fragments seem to
the best authorities to favour the theory that the unfortunate
vessel was struck by one of the huge icebergs which have lately
been floating up from the direction of the Admiralty Mountains, and
in that case her fate will probably remain one of the many
insoluble mysteries of the ocean</i>."</p>
<p>"Now that's what one might call the irony of fate," said the old
clergyman, "seeing that the object of the expedition . . ."</p>
<p>"Hush!"</p>
<p><i>"While the sympathy of the public will be extended to the
families of all the explorers who have apparently perished in a
brave effort to protect mankind from one of the worst dangers of
the great deep, the entire world will mourn the loss (as we fear it
may be) of the heroic young Commander, Doctor Martin Conrad, who
certainly belonged to the ever-diminishing race of dauntless and
intrepid souls who seem to be born will that sacred courage which
leads men to render up their lives at the lure of the Unknown and
the call of a great idea."</i></p>
<p>I felt as if I were drowning. At one moment there was the
shrieking of waves about my face; at the next the rolling of
billows over my head.</p>
<p><i>"Though it seems only too certain . . . this sacred courage
quenched . . . let us not think such lives as his are wasted . . .
only wasted lives . . . lives given up . . . inglorious ease . . .
pursuit of idle amusements. . . . Therefore let loved ones left
behind . . . take comfort . . . inspiring thought . . . if lost . .
. not died in vain . . . Never pleasure but Death . . . the lure
that draws true hearts. . . ."</i></p>
<p>I heard no more. The old colonel's voice, which had been beating
on my brain like a hammer, seemed to die away in the distance.</p>
<p>"How hard you are breathing. What is amiss?" said our
landlady.</p>
<p>I made no reply. Rising to my feet I became giddy and held on to
the table cloth to prevent myself from falling.</p>
<p>The landlady jumped up to protect her crockery and at the same
moment the old actress led me from the room. I excused myself on
the ground of faintness, and the heat of the house after my quick
walk home from the theatre.</p>
<p>Back in my bedroom my limbs gave way and I sank to the floor
with my head on the chair. There was no uncertainty for me now. It
was all over. The great love which had engrossed my life had
gone.</p>
<p>In the overwhelming shock of that moment I could not think of
the world's loss. I could not even think of Martin's. I could only
think of my own, and once more I felt as if something of myself had
been torn out of my breast.</p>
<p>"Why? Why?" I was crying in the depths of my heart&mdash;why,
when I was so utterly alone, so helpless and so friendless, had the
light by which I lived been quenched.</p>
<p>After a while the gong sounded for dinner. I got up and lay on
the bed. The young waiter brought up some dishes on a tray. I sent
them down again. Then time passed and again I heard voices on the
floor below.</p>
<p>"Rough on that young peeress if Conrad has gone down, eh?"</p>
<p>"What peeress?"</p>
<p>"Don't you remember&mdash;the one who ran away from that
reprobate Raa?"</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, certainly. I remember now."</p>
<p>"Of course, Conrad was the man pointed at, and perhaps if he had
lived to come back he might have stood up for the poor thing, but
now. . . ."</p>
<p>"Ah, well, that's the way, you see."</p>
<p>The long night passed.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seemed to go with feet of lead, sometimes with
galloping footsteps. I remember that the clocks outside seemed to
strike every few minutes, and then not to strike at all. At one
moment I heard the bells of a neighbouring church ringing merrily,
and by that I knew it was Christmas morning.</p>
<p>I did not sleep during the first hours of night, but somewhere
in the blank reaches of that short space between night and day
(like the slack-water between ebb and flow), which is the only time
when London rests, I fell into a troubled doze.</p>
<p>I wish I had not done so, for at the first moment of returning
consciousness I had that sense, so familiar to bereaved ones, of
memory rushing over me like a surging tide. I did not cry, but I
felt as if my heart were bleeding.</p>
<p>The morning dawned dark and foggy. In the thick air of my room
the window looked at me like a human eye scaled with cataract. It
was my first experience of a real London fog and I was glad of it.
If there had been one ray of sunshine that morning I think my heart
would have broken.</p>
<p>The cockney chambermaid came with her jug of hot water and
wished me "a merry Christmas." I did my best to answer her.</p>
<p>The young waiter came with my breakfast. I told him to set it
down, but I did not touch it.</p>
<p>Then the cockney chambermaid came back to make up my room and,
finding me still in bed, asked if I would like a fire. I answered
"Yes," and while she was lighting a handful between the two bars of
my little grate she talked of the news in the newspaper.</p>
<p>"It don't do to speak no harm of the dead, but as to them men as
'ad a collusion with a iceberg in the Australier sea, serve 'em
jolly well right I say. What was they a-doing down there, risking
their lives for nothing, when they ought to have been a-thinking of
their wives and children. My Tom wanted to go for a sailor, but I
wouldn't let him! Not me! 'If you're married to a sailor,' says I,
''alf your time you never knows whether you 'as a 'usband or
'asn't.' 'Talk sense,' says Tom. 'I <i>am</i> a-talking sense,'
says I, 'and then think of the kiddies,' I says."</p>
<p>After a while I got up and dressed and sat long hours before the
fire. I tried to think of others beside myself who must be
suffering from the same disaster&mdash;especially of Martin's
mother and the good old doctor. I pictured the sweet
kitchen-parlour in Sunny Lodge, with the bright silver bowls on the
high mantelpiece. There was no fire under the <i>slouree</i> now.
The light of that house was out, and two old people were sitting on
either side of a cold hearth.</p>
<p>I passed in review my maidenhood, my marriage, and my love, and
told myself that the darkest days of my loneliness in London had
hitherto been relieved by one bright hope. I had only to live on
and Martin would come back to me. But now I was utterly alone, I
was in the presence of nothingness. The sanctuary within me where
Martin had lived was only a cemetery of the soul.</p>
<p>"Why? Why? Why?" I cried again, but there was no answer.</p>
<p>Thus I passed my Christmas Day (for which I had formed such
different plans), and I hardly knew if it was for punishment or
warning that I was at last compelled to think of something besides
my own loss.</p>
<p>My unborn child!</p>
<p>No man on earth can know anything about that tragic prospect,
though millions of women must have had to face it. To have a child
coming that is doomed before its birth to be fatherless&mdash;there
is nothing in the world like that.</p>
<p>I think the bitterest part of my grief was that nobody could
ever know. If Martin had lived he would have leapt to acknowledge
his offspring in spite of all the laws and conventions of life. But
being dead he could not be charged with it. Therefore the name of
the father of my unborn child must never, never, never be
disclosed.</p>
<p>The thickening of the fog told me that the day was passing.</p>
<p>It passed. The houses on the opposite side of the square
vanished in a vaporous, yellow haze, and their lighted windows were
like rows of bloodshot eyes looking out of the blackness.</p>
<p>Except the young waiter and the chambermaid nobody visited me
until a little before dinner time. Then the old actress came up,
rather fantastically dressed (with a kind of laurel crown on her
head), to say that the boarders were going to have a dance and
wished me to join them. I excused myself on the ground of headache,
and she said:</p>
<p>"Young women often suffer from it. It's a pity, though!
Christmas night, too!"</p>
<p>Not long after she had gone, I heard, through the frequent
tooting of the taxis in the street, the sound of old-fashioned
waltzes being played on the piano, and then a dull thudding noise
on the floor below, mingled with laughter, which told me that the
old boarders were dancing.</p>
<p>I dare say my head was becoming light. I had eaten nothing for
nearly forty hours, and perhaps the great shock which chance had
given me had brought me near to the blank shadowland which is
death.</p>
<p>I remember that in some vague way there arose before me a desire
to die. It was not to be suicide&mdash;my religion saved me from
that&mdash;but death by exhaustion, by continuing to abstain from
food, having no desire for it.</p>
<p>Martin was gone&mdash;what was there to live for? Had I not
better die before my child came to life? And if I could go where
Martin was I should be with him eternally.</p>
<p>Still I did not weep, but&mdash;whether audibly or only in the
unconscious depths of my soul&mdash;more than once I cried to
Martin by name.</p>
<p>"Martin! Martin! I am coming to you!"</p>
<p>I was in this mood (sitting in my chair as I had done all day
and staring into the small slow fire which was slipping to the
bottom of the grate) when I heard a soft step in the corridor
outside. At the next moment my door was opened noiselessly, and
somebody stepped into the room.</p>
<p>It was Mildred, and she knelt by my side and said in a low
voice:</p>
<p>"You are in still deeper trouble, Mary&mdash;tell me."</p>
<p>I tried to pour out my heart to her as to a mother, but I could
not do so, and indeed there was no necessity. The thought that must
have rushed into my eyes was instantly reflected in hers.</p>
<p>"It is he, isn't it?" she whispered, and I could only bow my
head.</p>
<p>"I thought so from the first," she said. "And now you are
thinking of . . . of what is to come?"</p>
<p>Again I could only bow, but Mildred put her arms about me and
said:</p>
<p>"Don't lose heart, dear. Our Blessed Lady sent me to take care
of you. And I will&mdash;I will."</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM BY MARTIN CONRAD</p>
<p>Surely Chance must be the damnedest conspirator against human
happiness, or my darling could never have been allowed to suffer so
much from the report that my ship was lost.</p>
<p>What actually happened is easily told.</p>
<p>Two days after we left Akaroa, N.Z., which was the last we saw
of the world before we set our faces towards the Unknown, we ran
into a heavy lumpy sea and made bad weather of it for forty-eight
hours.</p>
<p>Going at good speed, however, we proceeded south on meridian 179
degrees E., latitude 68, when (just as we were sighting the
Admiralty Mountains, our first glimpse of the regions of the Pole)
we encountered a south-westerly gale, which, with our cumbersome
deck cargo, made the handling of the ship difficult.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the <i>Scotia</i> rode bravely for several hours
over the mountainous seas, though sometimes she rolled fifty
degrees from side to side.</p>
<p>Towards nightfall we shipped a good deal of water; the sea
smashed in part of our starboard bulwarks, destroyed the upper
deck, washed out the galley, carried off two of our life boats and
sent other large fragments of the vessel floating away to
leeward.</p>
<p>At last the pumps became choked, and the water found its way to
the engine-room. So to prevent further disaster we put out the
fires, and then started, all hands, to bale out with buckets.</p>
<p>It was a sight to see every man-jack at work on that job
(scientific staff included), and you would not have thought our
spirits were much damped, whatever our bodies may have been, if you
had been there when I cried, "Are we downhearted, shipmates?" and
heard the shout that came up from fifty men (some of them waist
deep in the water):</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>We had a stiff tussle until after midnight, but we stuck hard,
and before we turned into our bunks, we had fought the sea and
beaten it.</p>
<p>Next morning broke fine and clear, with that fresh crisp air of
the Antarctic which is the same to the explorer as the sniff of
battle to the warhorse, and no sign of the storm except the sight
of some lead-white icebergs which had been torn from the islands
south-west of us.</p>
<p>Everybody was in high spirits at breakfast, and when one of the
company started "Sweethearts and Wives" all hands joined in the
chorus, and (voice or no voice) I had a bit of a go at it
myself.</p>
<p>It is not the most solemn music ever slung together, but perhaps
no anthem sung in a cathedral has ascended to heaven with a
heartier spirit of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>When I went up on deck again, though, I saw that enough of our
"wooden walls" had gone overboard to give "scarey people" the
impression (if things were ever picked up, as I knew they would be,
for the set of the current was to the north-east) that we had
foundered, and that made me think of my dear one.</p>
<p>We had no wireless aboard, and the ship would not be going back
to New Zealand until March, so I was helpless to correct the error;
but I determined that the very first message from the very first
station I set up on the Antarctic continent should be sent to her
to say that I was safe and everything going splendid.</p>
<p>What happened on Christmas day is a longer story.</p>
<p>On the eighteenth of December, having landed some of my deck
cargo and provisions, and sent up my ship to winter quarters, I was
on my way, with ponies, dogs, and sledges and a large company of
men, all in A1 condition, to the lower summit of Mount Erebus, for
I intended to set up my first electric-power-wave station
there&mdash;that being high enough, we thought, to permit of a
message reaching the plateau of the Polar zone and low enough
(allowing for the curvature of the earth) to cover the maximum
distance in a northerly direction.</p>
<p>It was a long reach, but we chose the rocky ridges and moraines,
trying to avoid the crevassed glaciers, and all went well until the
twentieth, when just as we were reaching the steeper gradients a
strong wind sprang up, blowing straight down the course before
us.</p>
<p>All day long we toiled against it, but the weather grew worse,
with gusts of sleet and snow, until the wind reached the force of a
hurricane and the temperature fell to 28 degrees below zero.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do but to wait for the blizzard to blow
itself out, so we plugged down our tents in the shelter of the
rocky side of a ravine that had an immense snow-field behind
it.</p>
<p>The first night was bad enough, for the canvas of one tent flew
into ribbons, and the poor chaps in it had to lie uncovered in
their half-frozen sleeping-bags until morning.</p>
<p>All through the twenty-first, twenty-second, and twenty-third
the storm continued, sweeping with terrific force down the ravine,
and whirling the snow in dense masses from the snow-field
overhead.</p>
<p>Christmas Eve was worse, with the temperature down to 38 degrees
below zero and the wind up to eighty miles an hour in gusts, and
during the greater part of Christmas Day we were all confined to
our sleeping-bags and half buried in the snow that had drifted in
on us.</p>
<p>As a consequence we had no religious service, and if anybody
said a De Profundis it was between his crackling lips under his
frozen beard. We had no Christmas dinner either, except a few
Plasmon biscuits and a nip of brandy and water, which were served
out by good old O'Sullivan who had come with me as doctor to the
expedition.</p>
<p>On St. Stephen's Day I made a round of the camp and found the
ponies suffering terribly and the dogs badly hit. The storm was
telling on the men too, for some of them were down with dysentery,
and the toes of one poor chap were black from frostbite.</p>
<p>I was fit enough myself, thank God, but suffering from want of
sleep or rather from a restless feeling which broken sleep brought
with it.</p>
<p>The real truth is that never since I sailed had I been able to
shake off the backward thought that I ought not to have left my
dear one behind me. In active work, like the gale, I could dismiss
the idea of her danger; but now that I had nothing to do but to lie
like a log in a sleeping-bag, I suffered terribly from my
recollection of her self-sacrifice and my fear of the consequences
that might come of it.</p>
<p>This was not so bad in the daytime, for even in the midst of the
whirling snow and roaring wind I had only to close my eyes, and I
could see her as she came up the road in the sunshine that Sunday
morning when she was returning from church in her drooping hat and
fluttering veil, or as she looked at me with her great "seeing
eyes" at the last moment of all when she compelled me to come
away.</p>
<p>But the night was the devil. No sooner did I drop off to sleep
than I awoke with a start at the sound of her voice calling me by
my name.</p>
<p>"Martin! Martin!"</p>
<p>It was always a voice of distress, and though I am no dreamer
and I think no crank, I could not get away from the idea that she
was crying to me to come back.</p>
<p>That was about the one thing in the world that was impossible to
me now, and yet I knew that getting assurance from somewhere that
my dear one was being cared for was the only way to set my mind at
rest for the job that was before me.</p>
<p>It may seem ridiculous that I should have thought of that, but
everybody who has ever been with Nature in her mighty solitudes,
aloof from the tides of life, knows that the soul of man is
susceptible down there to signs which would seem childish amid the
noise and bustle of the world.</p>
<p>It was like that with me.</p>
<p>I shared my tent with O'Sullivan, the chief of our scientific
staff, and Treacle, who thought it his duty to take care of me,
though the work was generally the other way about.</p>
<p>The old salt had been badly battered, and I had not liked the
way he had been mumbling about "mother," which is not a good sign
in a stalwart chap when his strength is getting low.</p>
<p>So while buttoning up the tent on the night after Christmas Day
I was a bit touched up to see old Treacle, who had lived the life
of a rip, fumbling at his breast and hauling something out with an
effort.</p>
<p>It was a wooden image of the Virgin (about the length of my
hand) daubed over with gilt and blue paint, and when he stuck it up
in front of his face as he lay in his sleeping-bag, I knew that he
expected to go out before morning, and wished <i>that</i> to be the
last thing his old eyes should rest on.</p>
<p>I am not much of a man for saints myself (having found that we
get out of tight places middling well without them), but perhaps
what Treacle did got down into some secret place of my soul, for I
felt calmer as I fell asleep, and when I awoke it was not from the
sound of my darling's voice, but from a sort of deafening
silence.</p>
<p>The roaring of the wind had ceased; the blizzard was over; the
lamp that hung from the staff of the tent had gone out; and there
was a sheet of light coming in from an aperture in the canvas.</p>
<p>It was the midnight sun of the Antarctic, and when I raised my
head I saw that it fell full on the little gilded image of the
Virgin. Anybody who has never been where I was then may laugh if he
likes and welcome, but that was enough for me. It was all right!
Somebody was looking after my dear one!</p>
<p>I shouted to my shipmates to get up and make ready, and at dawn,
when we started afresh on our journey, there may have been dark
clouds over our heads but the sun was shining inside of us.</p>

<p>[END OF MARTIN CONRAD'S MEMORANDUM]</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="EIGHTY_FOURTH_CHAPTER" id=
"EIGHTY_FOURTH_CHAPTER"></a>EIGHTY-FOURTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Sister Mildred was right. Our Blessed Lady must have interceded
for me, because help came immediately.</p>
<p>I awoke on St. Stephen's morning with that thrilling emotion
which every mother knows to be the first real and certain
consciousness of motherhood.</p>
<p>It is not for me to describe the physical effects of that great
change. But the spiritual effect is another matter. It was like
that of a miracle. God in his great mercy, looking down on me in my
sorrow, had sent one of His ministering angels to comfort me.</p>
<p>It seemed to say:</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid. He who went away is not lost to you. Something
of himself is about to return."</p>
<p>I felt no longer that I was to be left alone in my prison-house
of London, because Martin's child was to bear me company&mdash;to
be a link between us, an everlasting bond, so that he and I should
be together to the end.</p>
<p>I tremble to say what interpretation I put upon all
this&mdash;how it seemed to be a justification of what I did on the
night before Martin left Ellan, as if God, knowing he would not
return, had prompted me, so that when my dark hour came I might
have this great hope for my comforter.</p>
<p>And oh how wonderful it was, how strange, how mysterious, how
joyful!</p>
<p>Every day and all day and always I was conscious of my unborn
child, as a fluttering bird held captive in the hand. The mystery
and the joy of the coming life soothed away my sorrow, and if I had
shed any tears they would have dried them.</p>
<p>And then the future!</p>
<p>I seemed to know from the first that it was to be a girl, and
already I could see her face and look into her sea-blue eyes. As
she grew up I would talk to her of her father&mdash;the brave
explorer, the man of destiny, who laid down his life in a great
work for the world. We should always be talking of him&mdash;we two
alone together, because he belonged to us and nobody else in the
world besides. Everything I have written here I should tell
her&mdash;at least the beautiful part of it, the part about our
love, which nothing in life, and not even death itself, could
quench.</p>
<p>Oh the joy of those days! It may seem strange that I should have
been so happy so soon after my bereavement, but I cannot help it if
it was so, and it <i>was</i> so.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a sort of hysteria, due to the great change in my
physical condition. I do not know. I do not think I want to know.
But one thing is sure&mdash;that hope and prayer and the desire of
life awoke in me again, as by the touch of God's own hand, and I
became another and a happier woman.</p>
<p>Such was the condition in which Mildred found me when she
returned a few days later. Then she brought me down plump to
material matters. We had first to consider the questions of ways
and means, in order to find out how to face the future.</p>
<p>It was the beginning of January, my appointed time was in June,
and I had only some sixteen pounds of my money left, so it was
clear that I could not stay in the boarding-house much longer.</p>
<p>Happily Mildred knew of homes where women could live
inexpensively during their period of waiting. They were partly
philanthropic and therefore subject to certain regulations, which
my resolute determination (not to mention Martin's name, or permit
it to be mentioned) might make it difficult for me to observe, but
Mildred hoped to find one that would take me on her recommendation
without asking further question.</p>
<p>In this expectation we set out in search of a Maternity Home.
What a day of trial we had! I shall never forget it.</p>
<p>The first home we called at was a Catholic one in the
neighbourhood of our boarding-house.</p>
<p>It had the appearance of a convent, and that pleased me
exceedingly. After we had passed the broad street door, with its
large brass plate and small brass grille, we were shown into a
little waiting-room with tiled floor, distempered walls, and
coloured pictures of the saints.</p>
<p>The porteress told us the Mother was at prayers with the
inmates, but would come downstairs presently, and while we waited
we heard the dull hum of voices, the playing of an organ, and the
singing of the sweet music I knew so well.</p>
<p>Closing my eyes I felt myself back in Rome, and began to pray
that I might be permitted to remain there. But the desire was
damped when the Mother entered the room.</p>
<p>She was a stout woman, wearing heavy outdoor boots and carrying
her arms interlaced before her, with the hands hidden in the ample
sleeves of her habit, and her face was so white and expressionless,
that it might have been cast in plaster of Paris.</p>
<p>In a rather nervous voice Mildred explained our errand.
"Mother," she said, "I cannot tell you anything about this young
lady, and I have come to ask if you will take her on my
recommendation."</p>
<p>"My dear child," said the Mother, "that would be utterly against
our rule. Not to know who the young lady is, where she comes from,
why she is here, and whether she is married or single or a
widow&mdash;it is quite impossible."</p>
<p>Mildred, looking confused and ashamed, said:</p>
<p>"She can afford to pay a little."</p>
<p>"That makes no difference."</p>
<p>"But I thought that in exceptional cases . . ."</p>
<p>"There can be no exceptional cases, Sister. If the young lady is
married and can say that her husband consents, or single and can
give us assurance that her father or guardian agrees, or a widow
and can offer satisfactory references . . ."</p>
<p>Mildred looked across at me, but I shook my head.</p>
<p>"In that case there seems to be nothing more to say," said the
Mother, and rising without ceremony she walked with us to the
door.</p>
<p>Our next call was at the headquarters of a home which was
neither Catholic nor Protestant, but belonged, Mildred said, to a
kind of Universal Church, admitting inmates of all
denominations.</p>
<p>It was in a busy thoroughfare and had the appearance of a
business office. After Mildred had written her name and the object
of our visit on a slip of paper we were taken up in a lift to
another office with an open safe, where a man in a kind of uniform
(called a Commissioner) was signing letters and cheques.</p>
<p>The Commissioner was at first very courteous, especially to me,
and I had an uncomfortable feeling that he was mistaking me for
something quite other than I was until Mildred explained our
errand, and then his manner changed painfully.</p>
<p>"What you ask is against all our regulations," he said. "Secrecy
implies something to hide, and we neither hide anything nor permit
anything to be hidden. In fact our system requires that we should
not only help the woman, but punish the man by making him realise
his legal, moral, and religious liability for his wrong-doing.
Naturally we can only do this by help of the girl, and if she does
not tell us at the outset who and what the partner of her sin has
been and where he is to be found. . . ."</p>
<p>I was choking with shame and indignation, and rising to my feet
I said to Mildred:</p>
<p>"Let us go, please."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes, I know," said the Commissioner, with a superior smile,
"I have seen all this before. The girl nearly always tries to
shield the guilty man. But why should she? It may seem generous,
but it is really wicked. It is a direct means of increasing
immorality. The girl who protects the author of her downfall is
really promoting the ruin of another woman, and if. . . ."</p>
<p>Thinking of Martin I wanted to strike the smug Pharisee in the
face, and in order to conquer that unwomanly impulse I hurried out
of the office, and into the street, leaving poor Mildred to follow
me.</p>
<p>Our last call was at the home of a private society in a little
brick house that seemed to lean against the wall of a large
lying-in hospital in the West End of London.</p>
<p>At the moment of our arrival the Matron was presiding in the
drawing-room over a meeting of a Missionary League for the
Conversion of the Jews, so we were taken through a narrow lobby
into a little back-parlour which overlooked, through a glass
screen, a large apartment, wherein a number of young women, who had
the appearance of dressmakers, ladies' maids, and governesses, were
sewing tiny pieces of linen and flannel that were obviously
baby-clothes.</p>
<p>There were no carpets on the floors and the house had a slight
smell of carbolic. The tick-tick of sewing machines on the other
side of the screen mingled with the deadened sound of the clapping
of hands in the room overhead.</p>
<p>After a while there was rustle of dresses coming down the bare
stairs, followed by the opening and closing of the front door, and
then the Matron came into the parlour.</p>
<p>She was a very tall, flat-bosomed woman in a plain black dress,
and she seemed to take in our situation instantly. Without waiting
for Mildred's explanation she began to ask my name, my age, and
where I came from.</p>
<p>Mildred fenced these questions as well as she could, and then,
with even more nervousness than ever, made the same request as
before.</p>
<p>The Matron seemed aghast.</p>
<p>"Most certainly not," she said. "My committee would never dream
of such a thing. In the interests of the unfortunate girls who have
fallen from the path of virtue, as well as their still more
unfortunate offspring, we always make the most searching inquiries.
In fact, we keep a record of every detail of every case. Listen to
this," she added, and opening a large leather-bound hook like a
ledger, she began to read one of its entries:</p>
<p><i>"H.J., aged eighteen years, born of very respectable parents,
was led astray</i> [that was not the word] <i>in a lonely road very
late at night by a sailor who was never afterwards heard of. . .
."</i></p>
<p>But I could bear no more, and rising from my seat I fled from
the room and the house into the noisy street outside.</p>
<p>All day long my whole soul had been in revolt. It seemed to me
that, while God in His gracious mercy was giving me my child to
comfort and console me, to uplift and purify me, and make me a
better woman than I had been before, man, with his false and cruel
morality, with his machine-made philanthropy, was trying to use it
as a whip to punish not only me but Martin.</p>
<p>But that it should never do! Never as long as I lived! I would
die in the streets first!</p>
<p>Perhaps I was wrong, and did not understand myself, and
certainly Mildred did not understand me. When she rejoined me in
the street we turned our faces homeward and were half way back to
the boarding-house before we spoke again.</p>
<p>Then she said:</p>
<p>"I am afraid the other institutions will be the same. They'll
all want references."</p>
<p>I answered that they should never get them.</p>
<p>"But your money will be done soon, my child, and then what is to
become of you?"</p>
<p>"No matter!" I said, for I had already determined to face the
world myself without help from anybody.</p>
<p>There was a silence again until we reached the door of our
boarding-house, and then Mildred said:</p>
<p>"Mary, your father is a rich man, and however much you may have
displeased him he cannot wish you to be left to the mercy of the
world&mdash;especially when your time comes. Let me write to him. .
. ."</p>
<p>That terrified me, for I saw only one result&mdash;an open
quarrel between my father and my husband about the legitimacy of my
child, who would probably be taken away from me as soon as it was
born.</p>
<p>So taking Mildred by the arm, regardless of the observation of
passers-by, I begged and prayed and implored of her not to write to
my father.</p>
<p>She promised not to do so, and we parted on good terms; but I
was not satisfied, and the only result of our day's journeying was
that I became possessed of the idea that the whole world was
conspiring to rob me of my unborn child.</p>
<p>A few days later Mildred called again, and then she said:</p>
<p>"I had another letter from Father Donovan this morning, Mary.
Your poor priest is broken-hearted about you. He is sure you are in
London, and certain you are in distress, and says that with or
without his Bishop's consent he is coming up to London to look for
you, and will never go back until you are found."</p>
<p>I began to suspect Mildred. In the fever of my dread of losing
my child I convinced myself that with the best intentions in the
world, merely out of love for me and pity for my position, she
would give me up&mdash;perhaps in the very hour of my peril.</p>
<p>To make this impossible I determined to cut myself off from her
and everybody else, by leaving the boarding-house and taking
another and cheaper lodging far enough away.</p>
<p>I was encouraged in this course by the thought of my diminishing
resources, and though heaven knows I had not too many comforts
where I was. I reproached myself for spending so much on my own
needs when I ought to be economising for the coming of my
child.</p>
<p>The end of it all was that one morning early I went down to the
corner of Oxford Street where the motor-omnibuses seem to come and
go from all parts of London.</p>
<p>North, south, east, and west were all one to me, leading to
labyrinths of confused and interminable streets, and I knew as
little as a child which of them was best for my purpose. But chance
seems to play the greatest part in our lives, and at that moment it
was so with me.</p>
<p>I was standing on the edge of the pavement when a motor-bus
labelled "Bayswater Road" stopped immediately in front of me and I
stepped into it, not knowing in the least why I did so.</p>
<p>Late that evening, having found what I wanted, I returned in the
mingled mist and darkness to the boarding-house to pack up my
belongings. That was not difficult to do, and after settling my
account and sending young John for a cab I was making for the door
when the landlady came up to me.</p>
<p>"Will you not leave your new address, my dear, lest anybody
should call," she said.</p>
<p>"Nobody will call," I answered.</p>
<p>"But in case there should he letters?"</p>
<p>"There will be no letters," I said, and whispering to the driver
to drive up Oxford Street, I got into the cab.</p>
<p>It was then quite dark. The streets and shops were alight, and I
remembered that as I crossed the top of the Charing Cross Road I
looked down in the direction of the lofty building in which
Mildred's window would be shining like a lighthouse over
Piccadilly.</p>
<p>Poor dear ill-requited Mildred! She has long ago forgiven me.
She knows now that when I ran away from the only friend I had in
London it was because I could not help it.</p>
<p>She knows, too, that I was not thinking of myself, and that in
diving still deeper into the dungeon of the great city, in hiding
and burying myself away in it, I was asking nothing of God but that
He would let me live the rest of my life&mdash;no matter how poor
and lonely&mdash;with the child that He was sending to be a living
link between my lost one and me.</p>
<p>In the light of what happened afterwards, that was all so
strange, and oh, so wonderful and miraculous!</p>

<h2><a name="EIGHTY_FIFTH_CHAPTER" id=
"EIGHTY_FIFTH_CHAPTER"></a>EIGHTY-FIFTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>My new quarters were in the poorer district which stands at the
back of Bayswater.</p>
<p>The street was a cul-de-sac (of some ten small houses on either
side) which was blocked up at the further end by the high wall of a
factory for the "humanization" of milk, and opened out of a busy
thoroughfare of interior shops like a gully-way off a noisy
coast.</p>
<p>My home in this street was in number one, and I had been
attracted to it by a printed card in the semi-circular fan-light
over the front door, saying: "A ROOM TO LET FURNISHED."</p>
<p>My room, which was of fair size, was on the first floor and had
two windows to the street, with yellow holland blinds and white
muslin curtains.</p>
<p>The furniture consisted of a large bed, a horse-hair sofa, three
cane-bottomed chairs, a chest of drawers (which stood between the
windows), and a mirror over the mantelpiece, which had pink paper,
cut into fanciful patterns, over the gilt frame, to keep off the
flies.</p>
<p>The floor was covered with linoleum, but there were two strips
of carpet, one before the fire and the other by the bed: the walls
were papered with a bright red paper representing peonies in bloom;
and there were three pictures&mdash;a portrait of a great Welsh
preacher with a bardic name ("Dyfed"), an engraving entitled "Feed
my Sheep" (showing Jesus carrying a lamb), and a memorial card of
some member of the family of the house, in the form of a tomb with
a weeping angel on either side.</p>
<p>I paid five shilling a week for my room, and, as this included
the use of kettle, cooking utensils, and crockery, I found to my
great delight at the end of the first week that providing for
myself (tea, bread and butter, and eggs being my principal food) I
had only spent ten shillings altogether, which, according to my
present needs, left me enough for my time of waiting and several
weeks beyond.</p>
<p>Every morning I went out with a little hand-bag to buy my
provisions in the front street; and every afternoon I took a walk
in the better part of Bayswater and even into the Park (Hyde Park),
which was not far off, but never near Piccadilly, or so far east as
Bloomsbury, lest I should meet Sister Mildred or be recognized by
the old boarders.</p>
<p>I had no key to my lodgings, but when I returned home I knocked
at the front door (which was at the top of a short flight of steps
from the pavement) and then a string was pulled in the
cellar-kitchen in which the family of my landlady lived, whereupon
the bolt was shot back and the door opened of itself.</p>
<p>Finding it necessary to account for myself here as at the
boarding-house, I had adhered to my former name, but said I was the
widow of a commander lately lost, at sea, which was as near to the
truth as I dared venture.</p>
<p>I had also made no disguise of the fact that I was expecting a
child, a circumstance which secured me much sympathy from the
kind-hearted souls who were now my neighbours.</p>
<p>They were all womanly women, generally the wives of men working
in the milk factory, and therefore the life of our street was very
regular.</p>
<p>At five in the morning you heard the halting step of the old
"knocker up," who went up and down the street tapping at the
bedroom windows with a long pole like a fishing-rod. A little
before six you heard the clashing of many front doors and the
echoing footsteps of the men going to their work. At half-past
seven you heard the whoop of the milkman and the rattling of his
cans. At half-past eight you heard the little feet of the children,
like the pattering of rain, going off to the Board School round the
corner. And a little after four in the afternoon you heard the wild
cries of the juvenile community let loose from lessons, the boys
trundling iron hoops and the girls skipping to a measured tune over
a rope stretched from parapet to parapet.</p>
<p>After that, our street hummed like a bee-hive, with the women,
washed and combed, standing knitting at their open doors or
exchanging confidences across the areas until darkness fell and
each of the mothers called her children into bed, as an old hen in
the farmyard clucks up her chickens.</p>
<p>These good creatures were very kind to me. Having satisfied
themselves from observation of my habits that I was "respectable,"
they called me "our lady"; and I could not help hearing that I was
"a nice young thing," though it was a little against me that I did
not go to church or chapel, and had confessed to being a
Catholic&mdash;for several of our families (including that of my
landlady) were members of the Welsh Zion Chapel not far away.</p>
<p>Such was the life of the little human cage to which I had
confined myself, but I had an inner life that was all my own and
very sweet to me.</p>
<p>During the long hours of every day in which I was alone I
occupied myself in the making of clothes for my baby&mdash;buying
linen and flannel and worsted, and borrowing patterns from my Welsh
landlady.</p>
<p>This stimulated my tenderness towards the child that was to
come, for the heart of a young mother is almost infantile, and I
hardly know whether to laugh or cry when I think of the childish
things I did and thought and said to myself in those first days
when I was alone in my room in that back street in Bayswater.</p>
<p>Thus long before baby was born I had christened her. At first I
wished to call her Mary, not because I cared for that name myself,
but because Martin had said it was the most beautiful in the world.
In the end, however, I called her Isabel Mary (because Isabel was
my mother's name and she had been a far better woman than I was),
and as I finished my baby's garments one by one I used to put them
away in their drawer, saying to myself, "That's Isabel Mary's
binder," or "Isabel Mary's christening-robe" as the case might
be.</p>
<p>I dare say it was all very foolish. There are tears in my eyes
when I think of it now, but there were none then, for though there
were moments when, remembering Martin, I felt as if life were for
ever blank, I was almost happy in my poor surroundings, and if it
was a cage I had fixed myself in there was always a bird singing
inside of it&mdash;the bird that sang in my own bosom.</p>
<p>"When Isabel Mary comes everything will he all right," I used to
think.</p>
<p>This went on for many weeks and perhaps it might have gone on
until my time was full but for something which, occurring under my
eyes, made me tremble with the fear that the life I was living and
the hope I was cherishing were really very wrong and selfish.</p>
<p>Of my landlady, Mrs. Williams, I saw little. She was a rather
hard but no doubt heavily-laden woman, who had to "do" for a swarm
of children, besides two young men lodgers who lived in the kitchen
and slept in the room behind mine. Her husband was a quiet man (a
carter at the dairy) whom I never saw at all except on the
staircase at ten o'clock at night, when, after winding the tall
clock on the landing, he went upstairs to bed in his stocking
feet.</p>
<p>But the outstanding member of the family for me was a
shock-headed girl of fourteen called Emmerjane, which was a running
version of Emma Jane.</p>
<p>I understood that Emmerjane was the illegitimate daughter of
Mrs. Williams's dead sister, and that she had been born in
Carnarvon, which still shimmered in her memory in purple and
gold.</p>
<p>Emmerjane was the drudge of the family, and I first saw her in
the street at dusk, mothering a brood of her little cousins, taking
Hughie by one hand and Katie by the other and telling Gwennie to
lay hold of Davie lest he should be run over by the milk vans.</p>
<p>Afterwards she became my drudge also&mdash;washing my floor,
bringing up my coals, and cleaning my grate, for sixpence a week,
and giving me a great deal of information about my neighbours for
nothing.</p>
<p>Thus she told me, speaking broad cockney with a Welsh accent,
that the people opposite were named Wagstaffe and that the creaking
noise I heard was that of a mangle, which Mrs. Wagstaffe had to
keep because her husband was a drunkard, who stole her money and
came home "a-Saturday nights, when the public-houses turned out,
and beat her somethink shockin'," though she always forgave him the
next day and then the creaking went on as before.</p>
<p>But the greatest interest of this weird little woman, who had a
premature knowledge of things a child ought not to know, was in a
house half-way down the street on the other side, where steam was
always coming from the open door to the front kitchen.</p>
<p>The people who lived there were named Jones. Mrs. Jones "washed"
and had a bed-ridden old mother (with two shillings from the
Guardians) and a daughter named Maggie.</p>
<p>Maggie Jones, who was eighteen, and very pretty, used to work in
the dairy, but the foreman had "tiken advantage of her" and she had
just had a baby.</p>
<p>This foreman was named Owen Owens and he lived at the last
number on our side, where two unmarried sisters "kept house" for
him and sat in the "singing seat" at Zion.</p>
<p>Maggie thought it was the sisters' fault that Owen Owens did not
marry her, so she conceived a great scheme for "besting" them, and
this was the tragedy which, through Emmerjane's quick little eyes
and her cockney-Welsh tongue, came to me in instalments day by
day.</p>
<p>When her baby was a month old Maggie dressed it up "fine" and
took it to the photographers for its "card di visit." The
photographs were a long time coming, but when they came they were
"heavenly lovely" and Maggie "cried to look at them."</p>
<p>Then she put one in an envelope and addressed it to Owen Owens,
and though it had only to cross the street, she went out after dark
to a pillar-box a long way off lest anybody should see her posting
it.</p>
<p>Next day she said, "He'll have it now, for he always comes home
to dinner. He'll take it up to his bedroom, look you, and stand it
on the washstand, and if either of those sisters touch it he'll
give them what's what."</p>
<p>After that she waited anxiously for an acknowledgment, and every
time the postman passed down our street her pretty pale face would
be at the door, saying, "Anything for me to-day?" or "Are you
<i>sure</i> there's nothing for me, postman?"</p>
<p>At length a letter came, and Maggie Jones trembled so much that
she dared not open it, but at last she tripped up to her room to be
"all of herself," and then . . . then there was a "wild screech,"
and when Emmerjane ran upstairs Maggie was stretched out on the
floor in a dead faint, clutching in her tight hand the photograph
which Owen Owens had returned with the words, written in his heavy
scrawl across the face&mdash;<i>Maggie Jones's bastard</i>.</p>
<p>It would be impossible to say how this incident affected me. I
felt as if a moral earthquake had opened under my feet.</p>
<p>What had I been doing? In looking forward to the child that was
to come to me I had been thinking only of my own comfort&mdash;my
own consolation.</p>
<p>But what about the child itself?</p>
<p>If my identity ever became known&mdash;and it might at any
moment, by the casual recognition of a person in the
street&mdash;how should the position of my child differ from that
of this poor girl?</p>
<p>A being born out of the pale of the law, as my husband would say
it must be, an outcast, a thing of shame, without a father to
recognise it, and with its mother's sin to lash its back for
ever!</p>
<p>When I thought of that, much as I had longed for the child that
was to be a living link between Martin and me, I asked myself if I
had any right to wish for it.</p>
<p>I felt I had no right, and that considering my helpless position
the only true motherly love was to pray that my baby might be
still-born.</p>
<p>But that was too hard. It was too terrible. It was like a second
bereavement. I could not and would not do it.</p>
<p>"Never, never, never!" I told myself.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="EIGHTY_SIXTH_CHAPTER" id=
"EIGHTY_SIXTH_CHAPTER"></a>EIGHTY-SIXTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Thinking matters out in the light of Maggie Jones's story, I
concluded that poverty was at the root of nearly everything. If I
could stave off poverty no real harm could come to my child.</p>
<p>I determined to do so. But there was only one way open to me at
present&mdash;and that was to retrench my expenses.</p>
<p>I did retrench them. Persuading myself that I had no real need
of this and that, I reduced my weekly outlay.</p>
<p>This gave me immense pleasure, and even when I saw, after a
while, that I was growing thin and pale, I felt no self-pity of any
sort, remembering that I had nobody to look well for now, and only
the sweet and glorious duty before me of providing for my
child.</p>
<p>I convinced myself, too, that my altered appearance was natural
to my condition, and that all I needed was fresh air and exercise,
therefore I determined to walk every day in the Park.</p>
<p>I did so once only.</p>
<p>It was one of those lovely mornings in early spring, when the
air and the sky of London, after the long fog and grime of winter,
seem to be washed by showers of sunshine.</p>
<p>I had entered by a gate to a broad avenue and was resting (for I
was rather tired) on a seat under a chestnut tree whose glistening
sheaths were swelling and breaking into leaf, when I saw a number
of ladies and gentlemen on horseback coming in my direction.</p>
<p>I recognised one of them instantly. It was Mr. Vivian, and a
beautiful girl was riding beside him. My heart stood still, for I
thought he would see me. But he was too much occupied with his
companion to do so.</p>
<p>"Yes, by Jove, it's killing, isn't it?" he said, in his shrill
voice, and with his monocle in his mole-like eye, he rode past me,
laughing.</p>
<p>After that I took my walks in the poorer streets behind
Bayswater, but there I was forced back on my old problem, for I
seemed to be always seeing the sufferings of children.</p>
<p>Thank God, children as a whole are happy. They seem to live in
their hearts alone, and I really and truly believe that if all the
doors of the rich houses of the West End of London were thrown open
to the poor children of the East End they would stay in their slums
and alleys.</p>
<p>But some of them suffer there for all that, especially the
unfortunate ones who enter the world without any legal right to be
here, and I seemed to be coming upon that kind everywhere.</p>
<p>One evening I saw a tiny boy of five sheltering from the rain
under a dripping and draughty railway arch, and crying as if his
little heart would break. I tried to comfort him and could not, but
when a rather shame-faced young woman came along, as if returning
from her work, he burst out on her and cried:</p>
<p>"Oh, muvver, she's been a-beating of me awrful."</p>
<p>"Never mind, Johnny," said the young woman, kneeling on the wet
pavement to dry the child's eyes. "Don't cry, that's a good
boy."</p>
<p>It needed no second sight to look into the heart of that
tragedy, and the effect of it upon me was to make me curtail my
expenditure still further.</p>
<p>Looking back on those days I cannot but wonder that I never
tried to find employment. But there was one delicate impediment
then&mdash;my condition, which was becoming visible, I thought, to
people in the street, and causing some of them, especially women,
to look round at me. When this became painful I discontinued my
walks altogether, and sent Emmerjane on my few errands.</p>
<p>Then my room became my world.</p>
<p>I do not think I ever saw a newspaper. And knowing nothing of
what was going on, beyond the surge and swell of the life of London
as it came to me when I opened my window. I had now, more than
ever, the sense of living in a dungeon on a rock in the middle of
the sea.</p>
<p>Having no exercise I ate less and less. But I found a certain
joy in that, for I was becoming a miser for my child's sake, and
the only pain I suffered was when I went to my drawer, as I did
every day, and looked at my rapidly diminishing store.</p>
<p>I knew that my Welsh landlady was beginning to call me
<i>close</i>, meaning mean; but that did not trouble me in the
least, because I told myself that every penny I saved out of my own
expenses was for my child, to keep her from poverty and all the
evils and injustices that followed in its train.</p>
<p>As my appointed time drew near my sleep was much broken; and
sometimes in the middle of the night, when I heard a solitary
footstep going down the street I would get up, draw aside one of my
blinds, and see a light burning in some bedroom window opposite,
and afterwards hear the muffled cry of the small new being who had
come as another immigrant into our chill little world.</p>
<p>But I made no arrangements for myself until my Welsh landlady
came up to my room one day and asked if I had settled with a
doctor. When I answered no, she held up her hands and cried:</p>
<p>"Good gracious! Just as I thought. Thee'st got to lose no time,
though."</p>
<p>Happily there was a doctor in our street nearly every day, and
if I wished it she would call him up to me. I agreed and the doctor
came next morning.</p>
<p>He was a tall, elderly man with cold eyes, compressed lips, and
a sour expression, and neither his manner nor his speech gave any
hint of a consciousness (which I am sure every true doctor must
have) that in coming to a woman in my condition he was entering one
of the sacred chambers of human life.</p>
<p>He asked me a few abrupt questions, told me when he would come
again, and then spoke about his fee.</p>
<p>"My fee is a guinea and I usually get it in advance," he said,
whereupon I went to my drawer, and took out a sovereign and a
shilling, not without a certain pang at seeing so much go in a
moment after I had been saving so long.</p>
<p>The doctor had dropped the money into his waistcoat pocket with
oh! such a casual air, and was turning to go, when my Welsh
landlady said:</p>
<p>"Her's not doing herself justice in the matter, of food,
doctor."</p>
<p>"Why, what do you eat?" asked the doctor, and as well as I
could, out of my dry and parched throat, I told him.</p>
<p>"Tut! tut! This will never do," he said. "It's your duty to your
child to have better food than that. Something light and nourishing
every day, such as poultry, fish, chicken broth, beef-tea, and
farinaceous foods generally."</p>
<p>I gasped. 'What was the doctor thinking about?</p>
<p>"Remember," he said, with his finger up, "the health of the
child is intimately dependent on the health of the mother. When the
mother is in a morbid state it affects the composition of the
blood, and does great harm to the health of the offspring, both
immediately and in after life. Don't forget now. Good day!"</p>
<p>That was a terrible shock to me. In my great ignorance and great
love I had been depriving myself for the sake of my child, and now
I learned that I had all the time been doing it a grave and perhaps
life-long injury!</p>
<p>Trying to make amends I sent out for some of the expensive foods
the doctor had ordered me, but when they were cooked I found to my
dismay that I had lost the power of digesting them.</p>
<p>My pain at this discovery was not lessened next day when my
Welsh landlady brought up a nurse whom I had asked her to engage
for me.</p>
<p>The woman was a human dumpling with a discordant voice, and her
first interest, like that of the doctor, seemed to centre in her
fee.</p>
<p>She told me that her usual terms were a guinea for the
fortnight, but when she saw my face fall (for I could not help
thinking how little I had left) she said:</p>
<p>"Some ladies don't need a fortnight, though. Mrs. Wagstaffe, for
instance, she never has no more than five days, and on the sixth
she's back at her mangle. So if five will do, ma'am, perhaps ten
and six won't hurt you."</p>
<p>I agreed, and the nurse was rolling her ample person out of my
room when my Welsh landlady said:</p>
<p>"But her's not eating enough to keep a linnet, look you."</p>
<p>And then my nurse, who was what the doctor calls a croaker,
began on a long series of stories of ladies who, having "let
themselves down" had died, either at childbirth or soon
afterwards.</p>
<p>"It's <i>after</i> a lady feels it if she has to nurse her
baby," said the nurse, "and I couldn't be responsible neither for
you nor the child if you don't do yourself justice."</p>
<p>This was a still more terrible possibility&mdash;the possibility
that I might die and leave my child behind me. The thought haunted
me all that day and the following night, but the climax came next
morning, when Emmerjane, while black-leading my grate, gave me the
last news of Maggie Jones.</p>
<p>Maggie's mother had been "a-naggin' of her to get work," asking
if she had not enough mouths to feed "without her bringin'
another."</p>
<p>Maggie had at first been afraid to look for employment, thinking
everybody knew of her trouble. But after her mother had put the
young minister from Zion on to her to tell her to be "obejent" she
had gone out every day, whether the weather was good or bad or
"mejum."</p>
<p>This had gone on for three months (during which Maggie used to
stay out late because she was afraid to meet her mother's face)
until one wet night, less than a week ago, she had come home
drenched to the skin, taken to her bed, "sickened for somethink"
and died.</p>
<p>Three days after Emmerjane told me this story a great solemnity
fell on our street.</p>
<p>It was Saturday, when the children do not go to school, but,
playing no games, they gathered in whispering groups round the
house with the drawn blinds, while their mothers stood bareheaded
at the doors with their arms under their aprons and their hidden
hands over their mouths.</p>
<p>I tried not to know what was going on, but looking out at the
last moment I saw Maggie Jones's mother, dressed in black, coming
down her steps, with her eyes very red and her hard face (which was
seamed with labour) all wet and broken up.</p>
<p>The "young minister" followed (a beardless boy who could have
known nothing of the tragedy of a woman's life), and stepping into
the midst of the group of the congregation from Zion, who had
gathered there with their warm Welsh hearts full of pity for the
dead girl, he gave out a Welsh hymn, and they sang it in the London
street, just as they had been used to do at the cottage doors in
the midst of their native mountains:</p>
<p>"<i>Bydd myrdd o ryfeddodau<br />
Ar doriad boreu wawr</i>."</p>
<p>I could look no longer, so I turned back into my room, but at
the next moment I heard the rumble of wheels and knew that Maggie
Jones was on her way to her last mother of all&mdash;the Earth.</p>
<p>During the rest of that day I could think of nothing but
Maggie's child, and what was to become of it, and next morning when
Emmerjane came up she told me that the "young minister" was
"a-gettin' it into the 'ouse."</p>
<p>I think that was the last straw of my burden, for my mind came
back with a swift rebound from Maggie Jones's child to my own.</p>
<p>The thought of leaving my baby behind now terrified and appalled
me. It brought me no comfort to think that though I was poor my
father was rich, for I knew that if he ever came to know of my
child's existence he would hate it and cast it off, as the central
cause of the downfall of his plans.</p>
<p>Yet Martin's child alone, and at the mercy of the world! It
could not and must not be!</p>
<p>Then came a fearful thought. I fought against it. I said many
"Hail Marys" to protect myself from it. But I could not put it
away.</p>
<p>Perhaps my physical condition was partly to blame. Others must
judge of that. It is only for me to say, in all truth and
sincerity, what I felt and thought when I stood (as every woman who
is to be a mother must) at the door of that dark chamber which is
Life's greatest mystery.</p>
<p>I thought of how Martin had been taken from me, as Fate (perhaps
for some good purpose still unrevealed) had led me to believe.</p>
<p>I thought of how I had comforted myself with the hope of the
child that was coming to be a link between us.</p>
<p>I thought of the sweet hours I had spent in making my baby's
clothes; in choosing her name; in whispering it to myself, yes, and
to God, too, every night and every morning.</p>
<p>I thought of how day by day I had trimmed the little lamp I kept
burning in the sanctuary within my breast where my baby and I lived
together.</p>
<p>I thought of how this had taken the sting out of death and
victory out of the grave. And after that I told myself that,
however sweet and beautiful, <i>all this had been selfishness and I
must put it away</i>.</p>
<p>Then I thought of the child itself, who&mdash;conceived in sin
as my Church would say, disinherited by the law, outlawed by
society, inheriting my physical weaknesses, having lost one of its
parents and being liable to lose the other&mdash;was now in danger
of being left to the mercies of the world, banned from its birth,
penniless and without a protector, to become a drudge and an
outcast or even a thief, a gambler, or a harlot.</p>
<p>This was what I thought and felt.</p>
<p>And when at last I knew that I had come to the end of my
appointed time I knelt down in my sad room, and if ever I prayed a
fervent prayer, if ever my soul went up to God in passionate
supplication, it was that the child I had longed for and looked
forward to as a living link with my lost one <i>might be born
dead</i>.</p>
<p>"Oh God, whatever happens to me, let my baby be born
dead&mdash;I pray, I beseech Thee."</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a wicked prayer. God knows. He will be just.</p>

<h2><a name="EIGHTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"EIGHTY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER"></a>EIGHTY-SEVENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>It was Saturday, the seventh of June. The summer had been a cold
one thus far; the night was chill and heavy rain was beating
against the window-pane.</p>
<p>There was a warm fire in my room for the first time for several
months; the single gas jet on the window side of the mantelpiece
had been turned low, and the nurse, in list slippers, was taking my
little flannel and linen garments out of the chest of drawers and
laying them on the flat steel fender.</p>
<p>I think I must have had intervals of insensibility, for the
moments of consciousness came and went with me, like the diving and
rising of a sea-bird in the midst of swelling waves.</p>
<p>At one such moment I became aware that the doctor and my Welsh
landlady, as well as my nurse, were in the room, and that they were
waiting for the crisis and fearing for my life.</p>
<p>I heard them talking in low voices which made a drumming noise
in my ears, like that which the sea makes when it is rolling into a
cave.</p>
<p>"She's let herself down so low, pore thing, that I don't know in
the world what's to happen to her."</p>
<p>"As God is my witness, look you, I never saw anybody live on so
little."</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of the mother. I'm more afraid of the child, if
you ask me."</p>
<p>Then the drumming noise would die out, and I would only hear
something within myself saying:</p>
<p>"Oh God, oh God, that my child may be born dead."</p>
<p>At another moment I heard, above the rattle of the rain, the
creaking of the mangle in the cellar-kitchen on the other side of
the street.</p>
<p>At still another moment I heard the sound of quarrelling in the
house opposite. A woman was screaming, children were shrieking, and
a man was swearing in a thick hoarse voice.</p>
<p>I knew what had happened&mdash;it was midnight, the
"public-houses had turned out," and Mr. Wagstaffe had came home
drunk.</p>
<p>The night passed heavily. I heard myself (as I had done before)
calling on Martin in a voice of wild entreaty:</p>
<p>"Martin! Martin!"</p>
<p>Then remembering that he was gone I began again to pray. I heard
myself praying to the Blessed Virgin:</p>
<p>"Oh, Mother of my God, let my child . . ."</p>
<p>But a voice which seemed to come from far away interrupted
me.</p>
<p>"Hush, b&acirc;ch, hush! It will make it harder for thee."</p>
<p>At length peace came. It seemed to me that I was running out of
a tempestuous sea, with its unlimited loneliness and cruel depth,
into a quiet harbour.</p>
<p>There was a heavenly calm, in which I could hear the doctor and
the nurse and my Welsh landlady talking together in cheerful
whispers.</p>
<p>I knew that everything was over, and with the memory of the
storm I had passed through still in my heart and brain. I said:</p>
<p>"Is it dead?"</p>
<p>"Dead?" cried the nurse in a voice several octaves higher than
usual. "Dear heart no, but alive and well. A beautiful little
girl!"</p>
<p>"Yes, your baby is all right, ma'am," said the doctor, and then
my Welsh landlady cried:</p>
<p>"Why did'st think it would be dead, bach? As I am a Christian
woman thee'st got the beautifullest baby that ever breathed."</p>
<p>I could bear no more. The dark thoughts of the days before were
over me still, and with a groan I turned to the wall. Then
everything was wiped out as by an angel's wing, and I fell into a
deep sleep.</p>
<p>When I awoke my dark thoughts were vanishing away like a bad
dream in the morning. The rain had ceased, the gas had been put
out, and I could see by the glow on the peonies of the wall-paper
that the sun was shining with a soft red light through the holland
blinds of my windows.</p>
<p>I heard the sparrows chirping on the sills outside; I heard the
milkman rattling his cans; I heard the bells of a neighbouring
church ringing for early communion.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and held my breath and listened to the sounds
in my own room. I heard the kettle singing over the fire; I heard
somebody humming softly, and beating a foot on the floor in time to
the tune and then I heard a low voice (it was Emmerjane's) saying
from somewhere near my bed:</p>
<p>"I dunno but what she's awake. Her breathing ain't a-goin'
now."</p>
<p>Then I turned and saw the nurse sitting before the fire with
something on her lap. I knew what it was. It was my child, and it
was asleep. In spite of my dark thoughts my heart yearned for
it.</p>
<p>And then came the great miracle.</p>
<p>My child awoke and began to cry. It was a faint cry, oh! so thin
and weak, but it went thundering and thundering through me. There
was a moment of awful struggle, and then a mighty torrent of love
swept over me.</p>
<p>It was Motherhood.</p>
<p>My child! Mine! Flesh of my flesh! Oh God! Oh God!</p>
<p>All my desire for my baby's death to save it from the pains of
life was gone, and my heart, starved so long, throbbed with
tenderness. I raised myself in bed, in spite of my nurse's protest,
and cried to her to give me my baby.</p>
<p>"Give her to me. Give her to me."</p>
<p>"By-and-by, by-and-by," said the nurse.</p>
<p>"Now, now! I can wait no longer."</p>
<p>"But you must take some food first. Emmerjane, give her that
glass of milk and water."</p>
<p>I drank the milk just to satisfy them, and then held out my arms
for my child.</p>
<p>"Give her to me&mdash;quick, quick!"</p>
<p>"Here she is then, the jewel!"</p>
<p>Oh! the joy of that moment when I first took my baby in my arms,
and looked into her face, and saw my own features and the sea-blue
eyes of Martin! Oh the rapture of my first eager kiss!</p>
<p>I suppose I must have been rough with my little cherub in the
fervour of my love, for she began to cry again.</p>
<p>"There! there!" said the nurse. "Be good now, or I must take
baby away."</p>
<p>But heaven had taught me another lesson, and instantly,
instinctively, I put my baby to my breast. Instantly and
instinctively, too, my baby turned to it with its little mouth open
and its little fingers feeling for the place.</p>
<p>"Oh God! My God! Oh Mother of my God!"</p>
<p>And then in that happiness that is beyond all earthly
bliss&mdash;the happiness of a mother when she first clasps her
baby to her breast&mdash;I began to cry.</p>
<p>I had not cried for months&mdash;not since that night in Ellan
which I did not wish to remember any more&mdash;but now my tears
gushed out and ran down my face like rain.</p>
<p>I cried on Martin once more&mdash;I could not help it. And
looking down at the closed eyes of my child my soul gushed out in
gratitude to God, who had sent me this for all I had suffered.</p>
<p>"Hush, hush! You will do yourself a mischief and it will be bad
for the milk," said the nurse.</p>
<p>After that I tried to control myself. But I found a fierce and
feverish delight in suckling my child. It seemed as if every drop
my baby drew gave me a spiritual as well as a physical
joy&mdash;cooling my blood and my brain and wiping out all my
troubles.</p>
<p>Oh mystery of mysteries! Oh miracle of miracles!</p>
<p>My baby was at my breast and my sufferings were at an end.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="EIGHTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER" id=
"EIGHTY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER"></a>EIGHTY-EIGHTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>That was a long, long day of happiness.</p>
<p>It was both very long and very short, for it passed like a
dream.</p>
<p>What wonderful happenings were crowded into it!</p>
<p>First the nurse, from the dizzy heights of her greater
experience and superior knowledge, indulged my infantile anxieties
by allowing me to look on while baby was being bathed, and rewarded
me for "being good" by many praises of my baby's beauty.</p>
<p>"I've nursed a-many in my time," she said, "but I don't mind
saying as I've never had a bonnier babby on my knee. Look at her
legs now, so white and plump and dimpled. Have you <i>ever</i> seen
anythink so putty?"</p>
<p>I confessed that I never had, and when nurse showed me how to
fix the binder, and put on the barrow-coat without disturbing baby
while asleep, I thought her a wonderful woman.</p>
<p>Emmerjane, who had with difficulty been kept out of the room
last night and was now rushing breathlessly up and down stairs,
wished to hold baby for a moment, and at length out of the
magnificence of my generosity I allowed her to do so, only warning
her, as she loved her life, to hold tight and not let baby
fall.</p>
<p>"How'd you mean?" said the premature little mother. "<i>Me</i>
let her fall? Not much!"</p>
<p>Every hour, according to the doctor's orders, I gave baby the
breast. I do not know which was my greatest joy&mdash;to feast my
eyes on her while she sucked and to see her little head fall back
with her little mouth open when she had had enough, or to watch her
when she stretched herself and hiccoughed, and then grasped my
thumb with her little tight fingers.</p>
<p>Oh, the wild, inexpressible delight of it!</p>
<p>Every hour had its surprise. Every few minutes had their cause
of wonder.</p>
<p>It rather hurt me when baby cried, and I dare say my own foolish
lip would drop at such moments, but when I saw that there were no
tears in her eyes, and she was only calling for her food, I pleaded
with nurse to let me give her the breast again.</p>
<p>The sun shone all day long, and though the holland window blinds
were kept down to subdue the light, for my sake and perhaps for
baby's, I thought my room looked perfectly beautiful. It might be
poor and shabby, but flights of angels could not have made it more
heavenly than it was in my eyes then.</p>
<p>In the afternoon nurse told me I must take some sleep myself,
but I would not sleep until baby slept, so she had to give me my
cherub again, and I sat up and rocked her and for a while I
sang&mdash;as softly as I could&mdash;a little lullaby.</p>
<p>It was a lullaby I had learned at Nemi from the Italian women in
embroidered outside stays, who so love their children; and though I
knew quite well that it had been written for the Mother of all
Mothers, who, after she had been turned away from every door, had
been forced to take refuge in a stable in Bethlehem, I was in such
an ecstasy of spiritual happiness that I thought it no irreverence
to change it a little and to sing it in my London lodging to my
human child.</p>
<p>"<i>Sleep, little baby, I love thee, I love thee,<br />
Sleep, little Queen, I am bending above thee</i>."</p>
<p>I dare say my voice was sweet that day&mdash;a mother's voice is
always sweet&mdash;for when Emmerjane, who had been out of the
room, came back to it with a look of awed solemnity, she said:</p>
<p>"Well, I never did! I thought as 'ow there was a' angel a-come
into this room."</p>
<p>"So there is, and here she is," I said, beaming down on my
sleeping child.</p>
<p>But the long, short, blissful day came to an end at last, and
when night fell and I dropped asleep, there were two names of my
dear ones on my lips, and if one of them was the name of him who
(as I thought) was in heaven, the other was the name of her who was
now lying in my arms.</p>
<p>I may have been poor, but I felt like a queen with all the
riches of life in my little room.</p>
<p>I may have sinned against the world and the Church, but I felt
as if God had justified me by His own triumphant law.</p>
<p>The whole feminine soul in me seemed to swell and throb, and
with my baby at my breast I wanted no more of earth or heaven.</p>
<p>I was still bleeding from the bruises of Fate, but I felt healed
of all my wounds, loaded with benefits, crowned with rewards.</p>
<p>Four days passed like this, varied by visits from the doctor and
my Welsh landlady. Then my nurse began to talk of leaving me.</p>
<p>I did not care. In my ignorance of my condition, and the greed
of my motherly love, I was not sorry she was going so soon. Indeed,
I was beginning to be jealous of her, and was looking forward to
having my baby all to myself.</p>
<p>But nurse, as I remember, was a little ashamed and tried to
excuse herself.</p>
<p>"If I hadn't promised to nurse another lady, I wouldn't leave
you, money or no money," she said. "But the girl" (meaning
Emmerjane) "is always here, and if she isn't like a nurse she's
'andy."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I shall be all right," I answered.</p>
<p>On the fifth day my nurse left me, and shocking as that fact
seems to me now, I thought little of it then.</p>
<p>I was entirely happy. I had nothing in the world except my baby,
and my baby had nothing in the world except me. I was still in the
dungeon that had seemed so dreadful to me before&mdash;the great
dungeon of London to one who is poor and friendless.</p>
<p>But no matter! I was no longer alone, for there was one more
inmate in my prison-house&mdash;my child.</p>

<h3>I AM LOST</h3>
<div class="center"><i>"Is it nothing to you, ye that pass by . . .
?"</i></div>
<h2>MEMORANDUM BY MARTIN CONRAD</h2>
<p>I hate to butt in where I may not be wanted, but if the
remainder of my darling's story is to be understood I must say what
was happening in the meantime to me.</p>
<p>God knows there was never a day on which I did not think of my
dear one at home, wondering what was happening to her, and whether
a certain dark fact which always lay at the back of my mind as a
possibility was actually coming to pass.</p>
<p>But she would be brave&mdash;I know that quite well&mdash;and I
saw plainly that, if I had to get through the stiff job that was
before me, I must put my shadowy fears away and think only of the
dangers I was sure about.</p>
<p>The first of these was that she might suppose our ship was lost,
so as soon as we had set up on old Erebus the wooden lattice towers
which contained our long-distance electric apparatus, I tried to
send her that first message from the Antarctic which was to say we
had not been shipwrecked.</p>
<p>It was a thrilling moment. Exactly at the stroke of midnight on
January 21, while the midnight sun was shining with its dull sullen
glow, the whole of our company having gathered round, the wireless
man prepared to despatch my message.</p>
<p>As we were not sure of our machinery I had drawn up the words to
suit any place into which they might fall if they missed their
intended destination:</p>
<p>"South Pole Expedition safe. All well. Send greetings to dear
ones at home."</p>
<p>For some forty seconds the sparks crackled out their snappy
signals into the crisp night air, and then the settled calm
returned, and we stood in breathless silence like beings on the
edge of a world waiting for the answer to come as from another
planet.</p>
<p>It came. After a few minutes we heard from our magnetic detector
the faint sound of the S signals, and then we broke into a great
cheer. It was not much, but it was enough; and while our scientific
staff were congratulating themselves that electric-wave telegraphy
was not inhibited by long distance, or by the earth's curvature
over an arc of a great circle, I was thinking of my dear
one&mdash;that one way or another my message would reach her and
she would be relieved.</p>
<p>Then in splendid health and spirits&mdash;dogs, ponies, and men
all A1&mdash;we started on our journey, making a bee-line for the
Pole.</p>
<p>Owing to the heavy weights we had to transport our progress was
slow, much slower than we had expected; and though the going was
fair and we kept a steady pace, travelling a good deal by night, it
was not until the end of March that we reached Mount Darwin, which
I had fixed on for the second of our electric power stations.</p>
<p>By this time winter was approaching, the nights were beginning
to be dark and cold, and the altitude (8000 ft.) was telling on
some of us.</p>
<p>Nevertheless our second installation got finished about the last
week in April, and again we gathered round (not quite such a hearty
company as before) while the wireless man spoke to the operator we
had left on Erebus.</p>
<p>Again the electrical radiations went crackling into space, and
again we gave a cheer when the answer came back&mdash;all well and
instruments in perfect order.</p>
<p>Then, late as it was, we began on the last stage of our journey,
which we knew would be a hard one. Three hundred geographical miles
in front; temperature down to minus 40&deg;; the sun several weeks
gone, and nothing before us but thickening twilight, cold winds,
snow, the rare aurora and the frequent moon.</p>
<p>But the worst fact was that our spirits were low, and do what I
would to keep a good heart and cheer up the splendid fellows who
had come with me, I could not help feeling the deepening effect of
that sunless gloom.</p>
<p>In spite of this, I broke camp on April 25, and started straight
as a die for the South.</p>
<p>It was a stiff fight over the upper glacier in latitude 85, with
its razor-shaped ice, full of snow-covered crevasses, and three
days out two of our best men fell into one of the worst of
them.</p>
<p>I saw the accident from a dozen yards away, and running up I lay
on my stomach and shouted down, but it was a black bottomless gulf
and not a sound or a sign came back to me.</p>
<p>This cast a still deeper gloom on our company, who could not be
cheered up, though I kept telling them we should be on the great
plateau soon, please God, and then we should have a clear road to
the Pole.</p>
<p>We were not much better on top though, for the surface was much
broken up, and in that brewing place of the winds there seemed to
be nothing but surging seas of cumulus cloud and rolling waves of
snow.</p>
<p>The Polar march was telling on us badly. We were doing no more
than seven miles at a stretch. So to help my shipmates to keep up
their spirits (and perhaps to give a bit of a "heise" to my own) I
had to sing all day long&mdash;though my darling is right that I
have no more voice than a corn-crake.</p>
<p>Sometimes I sang "Ramsey Town," because it did not want much
music, but generally "Sally's the gel for me," because it had a
rattling chorus. The men all joined in (scientific experts
included), and if the angels took any heed of us, I think it must
have touched them up to look down on our little company of puny men
singing away as we trudged through that snowy wilderness which
makes a man feel so small.</p>
<p>But man can only do his best, and as Father Dan (God bless his
old heart!) used to say, the angels can do no more. We were making
middling hard work of it in the 88th parallel, with a temperature
as low as 50 degrees of frost, when a shrieking, blinding blizzard
came sweeping down on us from the south.</p>
<p>I thought it might blow itself out, but it didn't, so we struck
camp in a broad half-circle, building igloos (snow huts) with their
backs (like rain-beaten cattle) to the storm.</p>
<p>There we lay nine days&mdash;and it is not worth while now to
say how much some of our men suffered from frozen fingers, and more
from falling spirits.</p>
<p>Sometimes I heard them saying (in voices that were intended to
be loud enough for me to hear) it would have been better to have
built winter quarters on the north of Darwin and settle there until
the return of summer. And at other times I heard them counting the
distance to the Pole&mdash;a hundred geographical miles, making
twenty days' march at this season, with the heavy weights we had to
carry, and the dwindling of our dogs and ponies, for we had killed
a lot of them for food.</p>
<p>But I would not give in, for I felt that to go back without
finishing my job would break my heart; and one day when old Treacle
said, "No use, guv'nor, let's give it best," I flew at him like a
hunted tiger.</p>
<p>All the same I was more than a bit down myself, for there were
days when death was very near, and one night it really broke me up
to hear a big strapping chap saying to the man who shared his
two-man sack, "I shouldn't care a whiff if it wasn't for the wife
and the kiddies."</p>
<p>God knows I had my own anchor at home, and sometimes it had a
devil of a tug at me. I fought myself hard, though, and at last in
my desire to go on and my yearning to go back to my dear one, I
made an awful proposal, such as a man does not much like to think
of after a crisis is over.</p>
<p>"Shipmates," I said, "it isn't exactly my fault that we are here
in the middle of winter, but here we are, and we must make the best
of it. I am going forward, and those who want to go with me can go.
But those who don't want to go can stay; and so that no one may
have it on his conscience that he has kept his comrades back,
whether by weakness or by will, I have told the doctor to serve out
a dose of something to every man, that he may end it whenever he
wants to."</p>
<p>To my surprise that awful proposal was joyfully received; and
never so long as I live shall I forget the sight o' O'Sullivan
going round the broad circle of my shipmates in the blue gloom of
that noonday twilight and handing something to every one of them,
while nobody spoke, and Death seemed to look us in the face.</p>
<p>And now I come to the incident for which I have told this
story.</p>
<p>I could not get a wink of sleep that night for thinking of the
brave fellows I had doomed to death by their own hands (for that
was what it came to), because their souls were starving and they
were thinking of home.</p>
<p>My soul was starving too, and whether it was the altitude (now
11,000 ft.) that was getting into my head, and giving me that
draught in the brain which only travellers in frozen regions know,
or the Power higher than Nature which speaks to a man in great
solitudes when life is low, I cannot say, but as God is my witness,
I was hearing again the voices of my dear ones so far away.</p>
<p>Sometimes they were the voices of my old people in Ellan, but
more frequently, and most importunately, it was Mary's voice,
calling me by my name, and crying to me for help as if she were in
the shadow of some threatening danger.</p>
<p>"Martin! Martin! Martin!"</p>
<p>When this idea took clear possession of me&mdash;it was about
three a.m. and the hurricane was yowling like a wounded
dog&mdash;the answering thought came quick. I must go back. No
matter at what cost or sacrifice&mdash;I must go back.</p>
<p>It was in vain I reflected that the trouble which threatened my
darling (whatever it was, and I thought I knew) might be all over
before I reached her side&mdash;I must go back.</p>
<p>And even when I reminded myself that I was within twenty days'
march of that last point of my journey which was to be the crown
and completion of it all, I also remembered that my dear one was
calling me, and I had no choice but to obey.</p>
<p>Next morning, in the first light of the dim Antarctic glow, I
crept out of my snow hut to look south with powerful glasses in
order to make sure that there was no reason why I should change my
mind.</p>
<p>There was none. Although the snow had ceased the blizzard was
blowing a hundred miles an hour in cutting gusts, so with a
bleeding heart (and yet a hot one) I told Treacle to call rip our
company, and when they stood round me in the shelter of my hut I
said:</p>
<p>"Shipmates, I have been thinking things over during the night,
and I see them differently now. Nature is stronger than man, and
the nature that is inside of us sometimes hits us harder than that
which is without. I think it is that way with us here, and I
believe there isn't a man of you who wouldn't go forward with me if
he had nobody to think of except himself. . . . Well, perhaps
<i>I</i> have somebody to think of, too, so we'll stick together,
shipmates, and whatever regrets there may be, or disappointments,
or heart-breakings, we'll . . . we'll go back home."</p>
<p>I think it says something for the mettle my men were made of
that there was never a cheer after I said that, for they could see
what it cost me to say it. But by God, there was a shout when I
added:</p>
<p>"We've drawn a blank this time, boys, but we'll draw a winner
yet, and I ask you to swear that you'll come back with me next
year, please God, to finish the work we've begun."</p>
<p>Then we gripped hands in that desolate place, and took our
solemn oath, and God knows we meant to keep it.</p>
<p>It did not take long to strike camp, I can tell you. The men
were bustling about like boys and we had nothing to think of now
but the packing of the food and the harnessing of the dogs and
ponies, for we were leaving everything else behind us.</p>
<p>At the last moment before we turned northward I planted the
Union Jack on the highest hummock of snow, and when we were a
hundred yards off I looked back through the gloom and saw it
blowing stiffly in the wind.</p>
<p>I don't think I need tell how deeply that sight cut me, but if
life has another such moment coming for me all I have to say is
that I hope I may die before I live to see it&mdash;which is Irish,
but most damnably true.</p>
<p>That was twelve o'clock noon on the eighth day of June and
anybody may make what he likes of what I say, but as nearly as I
can calculate the difference of time between London and where we
were in the 88th latitude it was the very hour of my dear one's
peril.</p>

<h2><a name="EIGHTY_NINTH_CHAPTER" id=
"EIGHTY_NINTH_CHAPTER"></a>EIGHTY-NINTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Two weeks passed and if I suffered from getting up too soon I
was never conscious of it.</p>
<p>Once or twice, perhaps, in the early days I felt a certain
dizziness and had to hold on for a moment to the iron rail of my
bedstead, but I was too much occupied with the tender joys of
motherhood to think much about myself.</p>
<p>Bathing, dressing, undressing, and feeding my baby were a
perpetual delight to me.</p>
<p>What a joy it all was!</p>
<p>There must he something almost animal, even voluptuous, in
mothers' love, for there was nothing I liked so much as having baby
naked on my knee and devouring its sweet body all over with
kisses&mdash;putting its little fat hands and even its little fat
feet into my mouth.</p>
<p>There must be something almost infantile, too, for sometimes
after I had talked to my darling with a flood of joyous chatter I
would even find myself scolding her a little, and threatening what
I would do if she did not "behave."</p>
<p>Oh, mysterious laws of motherhood! Only God can fathom the
depths of them.</p>
<p>It was just as if sixteen years of my life had rolled back, and
I was again a child in my mother's room playing with my dolls under
the table. Only there was something so wonderful now in the sweet
eyes that looked up at me, that at certain moments I would fall
into a long reverie and my heart would be full of adoration.</p>
<p>What lengths I went to!</p>
<p>It was the height of the London season when baby came; and
sometimes at night, looking through my window, I saw the tail-end
of the long queue of carriages and electric broughams which
stretched to the end of the street I lived in, from the great
houses fronting the Park where balls and receptions were being held
until the early hours of morning. But I never envied the society
ladies they were waiting for. On the contrary I pitied them,
remembering they were childless women for the most part and
thinking their pleasures were hollow as death compared with
mine.</p>
<p>I pitied the rich mothers too&mdash;the mothers who banish their
babies to nurseries to be cared for by servants, and I thought how
much more blessed was the condition of poor mothers like myself who
kept all that sweetness to themselves.</p>
<p>How happy I was! No woman coming into a fortune was ever so
happy. I sang all day long. Sometimes it was the sacred music of
the convent in which each note, with its own glory of sound, wraps
one's heart round as with a rainbow, but more frequently it was
"Ramsey Town" or "Sally's the gel for me," which were only noisy
nonsense but dear to me by such delicious memories.</p>
<p>My neighbours would come to their doors to listen, and when I
had stopped I would hear them say:</p>
<p>"Our lady is a 'appy 'cart, isn't she?"</p>
<p>I suppose it was because I was so happy that my looks returned
to me, though I did not know it was so until one morning, after
standing a moment at the window, I heard somebody say:</p>
<p>"Our lady seems to be prettier than ever now her baby has
come."</p>
<p>I should not have been a woman if I could have resisted that, so
I ran to the glass to see if it was true, and it was.</p>
<p>The ugly lines that used to be in my cheeks had gone, my hair
had regained its blue-black lustre, and my eyes had suddenly become
bright like a darkened room when the shutters are opened and the
sunshine streams into it.</p>
<p>But the coming of baby did better for me than that. It brought
me back to God, before whom I now felt so humble and so glad,
because he had transformed the world for me.</p>
<p>Every Catholic will know why I could not ask for the benediction
of the Church after childbirth; but he will also know why I was in
a fever of anxiety to have my baby baptized at the earliest
possible moment. It was not that I feared her death (I never
thought of that in those days), but because I lived in dread of the
dangers which had darkened my thoughts before she was born.</p>
<p>So when baby was nearly a fortnight old I wrote to the Rector of
a neighbouring Catholic Church asking when I might bring her to be
baptized, and he sent me a printed reply, giving the day and hour,
and enclosing a card to be filled up with her name and all other
particulars.</p>
<p>What a day of joy and rapture was that of my baby's baptism! I
was up with the sun on the morning appointed to take her to church
and spent hours and hours in dressing her.</p>
<p>How lovely she looked when I had finished! I thought she was the
sweetest thing in the world, sweeter than a rosebud under its
sparkling web of dew when the rising sun is glistening on it.</p>
<p>After I had put on all the pretty clothes I had prepared for her
before she was born&mdash;the christening robe and the pelisse and
the knitted bonnet with its pink ribbons and the light woollen
veil&mdash;I lifted her up to the glass to look at herself, being
such a child myself and so wildly, foolishly happy.</p>
<p>"That old Rector won't see anything equal to her <i>this</i>
summer morning anyway," I thought.</p>
<p>And then the journey to church!</p>
<p>I have heard that unmarried mothers, going out for the first
time after their confinement, feel ashamed and confused, as if
every passer-by must know their shameful secret. I was a kind of
unmarried mother myself, God help me, but I had no such feeling.
Indeed I felt proud and gay, and when I sailed out with my baby in
my arms I thought all the people in our street were looking at me,
and I am sure I wanted to say "Good morning" to everybody I met on
my way.</p>
<p>The church was not in a joyous quarter. It stood on the edge of
a poor and very populous district, with a flaunting public-house
immediately opposite. When I got to it I found a number of other
mothers (all working women), with their babies and the godfathers
and godmothers they had provided for them, waiting at the door.</p>
<p>At this sight I felt very stupid, for I had been thinking so
much about other things (some of them vain enough perhaps) that I
had forgotten the necessity for sponsors; and I do not know what I
should have done at that last moment if the sacristan had not come
to my relief&mdash;finding me two old people who, for a fee of a
shilling each, were willing to stand godmother and godfather to my
darling.</p>
<p>Then the priest came out of the church in his white surplice and
stole, and we all gathered in the porch for the preliminary part of
the sacrament.</p>
<p>What an experience it was! Never since my marriage had I been in
a state of such spiritual exaltation.</p>
<p>The sacristan, showing me some preference, had put me in the
middle of the row, immediately in front of the priest, so what
happened to the other children I do not know, having eyes and ears
for nothing but the baptism of my own baby.</p>
<p>There were some mistakes, but they did not trouble me, although
one was a little important.</p>
<p>When the priest said, "What name give you this child?" I handed
the Rector's card to the sacristan, and whispered "Isabel Mary" to
the godmother, but the next thing I heard was:</p>
<p>"Mary Isabel, what dost thou ask of the Church of God?"</p>
<p>But what did it matter? Nothing mattered except one
thing&mdash;that my darling should be saved by the power of the
Holy Sacrament from the dark terrors which threatened her.</p>
<p>Oh, it is a fearful and awful thing, the baptism of a child, if
you really and truly believe in it. And I did&mdash;from the bottom
of my heart and soul I believed in it and trusted it.</p>
<p>In my sacred joy I must have cried nearly all the time, for I
had taken baby's bonnet off, I remember, and holding it to my mouth
I found after a while that I was wetting it with my tears.</p>
<p>When the exorcisms were over, the priest laid the end of his
stole over baby's shoulder and led her (as our prayer books say)
into the church, and we all followed to the baptistery, where I
knelt immediately in front of the font, with the old godmother
before me, the other mothers on either side, and a group of
whispering children behind.</p>
<p>The church was empty, save for two charwomen who were sweeping
the floor of the nave somewhere up by the dark and silent altar;
and when the sacristan closed the outer door there was a solemn
hush, which was broken only by the priest's voice and the
godparents' muttered responses.</p>
<p>"Mary Isabel, dost thou renounce Satan?"</p>
<p>"I do renounce him."</p>
<p>"And all his works?"</p>
<p>"I do renounce them."</p>
<p>"And all his pomps?"</p>
<p>"I do renounce them."</p>
<p>The actual baptism was like a prayer to me. I am sure my whole
soul went out to it. And though I may have been a sinful woman
unworthy to be churched, I know, and God knows, that no chaste and
holy nun ever prayed with a purer heart than I did then, kneeling
there with my baby's bonnet to my mouth.</p>
<p>"Mary Isabel, I baptize thee in the name of the Father + and of
the Son + and of the Holy Ghost.+"</p>
<p>Except that baby cried a little when the water was poured on her
head (as she had cried when the salt was put on her tongue), I knew
no more after that until I saw the candle in the godfather's hand
(which signified that my child had been made a Child of Light) and
heard the priest say:</p>
<p>"Go in peace and the Lord be with thee."</p>
<p>Then I awoke as from a trance. There was a shuffling of feet.
The priest was going away. The solemn rite was at an end.</p>
<p>I rose from my knees, put a little money in the plate which the
sacristan held out to me, gave a shilling to each of the two old
sponsors, took baby back into my arms, and sat down in a pew to put
on her bonnet and veil.</p>
<p>The spiritual exaltation which had sustained me lasted until I
reached the street where the other mothers and their friends were
laughing and joking, in voices that had to be pitched high over the
rattle of the traffic, about going to the house opposite to "wet
the baby's head."</p>
<p>But I think something of the celestial light of the sacrament
must have been on my face still when I reached home, for I remember
that as I knocked at the door, and waited for the rope from the
kitchen to open it, I heard one of my neighbours say:</p>
<p>"Our lady has taken a new lease of life, hasn't she?"</p>
<p>I thought I had&mdash;a great new lease of physical and
spiritual life.</p>
<p>But how little did I know what Fate had in store for me!</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="NINETIETH_CHAPTER" id=
"NINETIETH_CHAPTER"></a>NINETIETH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I was taking off baby's outdoor things when my Welsh landlady
came up to ask how I had got on, and after I had told her she
said:</p>
<p>And now thee'st got to get the jewel registered."</p>
<p>"Registered?"</p>
<p>"Within three weeks. It's the law, look you."</p>
<p>That was the first thing that frightened me. I had filled up
truthfully enough the card which the Rector had sent me, because I
knew that the register of my Church must be as sacred as its
confessional.</p>
<p>But a public declaration of my baby's birth and parentage seemed
to be quite another matter&mdash;charged with all the dangers to
me, to Martin, and above all to my child, which had overshadowed my
life before she was born.</p>
<p>More than once I felt tempted to lie, to make a false
declaration, to say that Martin had been my husband and Isabel was
my legitimate child.</p>
<p>But at length I resolved to speak the truth, the plain truth,
telling myself that God's law was above man's law, and I had no
right to be ashamed.</p>
<p>In this mood I set off for the Registry Office. It was a long
way from where I lived, and carrying baby in my arms I was tired
when I got there.</p>
<p>I found it to be a kind of private house, with an open vestibule
and a black-and-white enamelled plate on the door-post, saying
"Registry of Births and Deaths."</p>
<p>In the front parlour (which reminded me of Mr. Curphy's office
in Holmtown) there was a counter by the door and a large table
covered with papers in the space within.</p>
<p>Two men sat at this table, an old one and a young one, and I
remember that I thought the old one must have been reading aloud
from a newspaper which he held open in his hand, for as I entered
the young one was saying:</p>
<p>"Extraordinary! Perfectly extraordinary! And everybody thought
they were lost, too!"</p>
<p>In the space between the door and the counter two women were
waiting. Both were poor and obviously agitated. One had a baby in
her arms, and when it whimpered for its food she unbuttoned her
dress and fed it openly. The other woman, whose eyes were red as if
she had been crying, wore a coloured straw hat over which, in a
pitiful effort to assume black, she had stretched a pennyworth of
cheap cr&ecirc;pe.</p>
<p>In his own good time the young man got up to attend to them. He
was a very ordinary young clerk in a check suit, looking frankly
bored by the dull routine of his daily labour, and palpably
unconscious of the fact that every day and hour of his life he was
standing on the verge of the stormiest places of the soul.</p>
<p>Opening one of two registers which lay on the counter (the
Register of Births) he turned first to the woman with the child.
Her baby, a boy, was illegitimate, and in her nervousness she
stumbled and stammered, and he corrected her sharply.</p>
<p>Then opening the other register (the Register of Deaths) he
attended to the woman in the cr&ecirc;pe. She had lost her little
girl, two years old, and produced a doctor's certificate. While she
gave the particulars she held a soiled handkerchief to her mouth as
if to suppress a sob, but the young clerk's composure remained
undisturbed.</p>
<p>I do not know if it was the agitation of the two poor women that
made me nervous, but when they were gone and my turn had come, I
was hot and trembling.</p>
<p>The young clerk, however, who was now looking at me for the
first time, had suddenly become respectful. With a bow and a smile
he asked me if I wished to register my child, and when I answered
yes he asked me to be good enough to step up to the counter.</p>
<p>"And what is your baby's name, please?" he asked.</p>
<p>I told him. He dipped his pen in his metal ink-pot, shook some
drops back, made various imaginary flourishes over his book and
wrote:</p>
<p>"Mary Isabel."</p>
<p>"And now," he said, with another smile, "the full name,
profession, and place of residence of the father."</p>
<p>I hesitated for a moment, and then, making a call on my
resolution, I said:</p>
<p>"Martin Conrad, seaman, deceased."</p>
<p>The young clerk looked up quickly.</p>
<p>"Did you say Martin Conrad, ma'am?" he asked, and as well as I
could for a click in my throat I answered:</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>He paused as if thinking; then with the same flourish as before
he wrote that name also, and after he had done so, he twisted his
face about to the old man, who was sitting behind him, and said, in
a voice that was not meant to reach me:</p>
<p>"Extraordinary coincidence, isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Extraordinary!" said the old man, who had lowered his newspaper
and was looking across at me over the rims of his spectacles.</p>
<p>"And now," said the young clerk, "your own name and your maiden
name if you please."</p>
<p>"Mary O'Neill."</p>
<p>The young clerk looked up at me again. I was holding baby on my
left arm and I could see that his eye caught my wedding ring.</p>
<p>"Mary Conrad, maiden name O'Neill, I presume?" he said.</p>
<p>I hesitated once more. The old temptation was surging back upon
me. But making a great pull on my determination to tell the truth
(or what I believed to be the truth) I answered:</p>
<p>"No, Mary O'Neill simply."</p>
<p>"Ah!" said the young clerk, and I thought his manner changed
instantly.</p>
<p>There was silence for some minutes while the young clerk filled
up his form and made the copy I was to carry away.</p>
<p>I heard the scratching of the young clerk's pen, the crinkling
of the old man's newspaper, the hollow ticking of a round clock on
the wall, the dull hum of the traffic in the streets, and the
thud-thud-thudding in my own bosom.</p>
<p>Then the entry was read out to me and I was asked to sign
it.</p>
<p>"Sign here, please," said the young clerk in quite a different
tone, pointing to a vacant line at the bottom of the hook, and I
signed with a trembling hand and a feeling of only partial
consciousness.</p>
<p>I hardly know what happened after that until I was standing in
the open vestibule, settling baby on my arm afresh for my return
journey, and telling myself that I had laid a stigma upon my child
which would remain with her as long as she lived.</p>
<p>It was a long, long way back, I remember, and when I reached
home (having looked neither to the right nor left, nor at anything
or anybody, though I felt as if everybody had been looking at me) I
had a sense of dimness of sight and of aching in the eyeballs.</p>
<p>I did not sing very much that day, and I thought baby was rather
restless.</p>
<p>Towards nightfall I had a startling experience.</p>
<p>I was preparing Isabel for bed, when I saw a red flush, like a
rash, down the left side of her face.</p>
<p>At first I thought it would pass away, but when it did not I
called my Welsh landlady upstairs to look at it.</p>
<p>"Do you see something like a stain on baby's face?" I asked, and
then waited breathlessly for her answer.</p>
<p>"No . . . Yes . . . Well," she said, "now that thee'st saying so
. . . perhaps it's a birthmark."</p>
<p>"A birthmark?"</p>
<p>"Did'st strike thy face against anything when baby was
coming?"</p>
<p>I made some kind of reply, I hardly know what, but the truth, or
what I thought to be the truth, flashed on me in a moment.</p>
<p>Remembering my last night at Castle Raa, and the violent scene
which had occurred there, I told myself that the flush on baby's
face was the mark of my husband's hand which, making no impression
upon me, had been passed on to my child, and would remain with her
to the end of her life, as the brand of her mother's shame and the
sign of what had been called her bastardy.</p>
<p>How I suffered at the sight of it! How time after time that
night I leaned over my sleeping child to see if the mark had passed
away! How again and again I knelt by her side to pray that if sin
of mine had to be punished the punishment might fall on me and not
on my innocent babe!</p>
<p>At last I remembered baby's baptism and told myself that if it
meant anything it meant that the sin in which my child had been
born, the sin of those who had gone before her (if sin it was), had
been cast out of her soul with the evil spirits which had inspired
them.</p>
<p>"<i>This sign of the Holy Cross + which we make upon her
forehead do thou, accursed devil, never dare to violate</i>."</p>
<p>God's law had washed my darling white! What could man's
law&mdash;his proud but puny morality&mdash;do to injure her? It
could do nothing!</p>
<p>That comforted me. When I looked at baby again the flush had
gone and I went to bed quite happy.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="NINETY_FIRST_CHAPTER" id=
"NINETY_FIRST_CHAPTER"></a>NINETY-FIRST CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I think it must have been the morning of the next day when the
nurse who had attended me in my confinement came to see how I was
going along.</p>
<p>I told her of the dimness of my sight and the aching of my
eyeballs, whereupon she held up her hands and cried:</p>
<p>"There now! What did I tell you? Didn't I say it is <i>after</i>
a lady feels it?"</p>
<p>The moral of her prediction was that, being in a delicate state
of health, and having "let myself low" before baby was born, it was
my duty to wean her immediately.</p>
<p>I could not do it.</p>
<p>Although the nurse's advice was supported by my Welsh landlady
(with various prognostications of consumption and rickets), I could
not at first deny myself the wild joy of nursing my baby.</p>
<p>But a severer monitor soon came to say that I must. I found that
my money was now reduced to little more than two pounds, and that I
was confronted by the necessity (which I had so long put off) of
looking for employment.</p>
<p>I could not look for employment until I had found a nurse for my
child, and I could not find a nurse until my baby could do without
me, so when Isabel was three weeks old I began to wean her.</p>
<p>At first I contented myself with the hours of night, keeping a
feeding-bottle in bed, with the cow's milk warmed to the heat of my
own body. But when baby cried for the breast during the day I could
not find it in my heart to deny her.</p>
<p>That made the time of weaning somewhat longer than it should
have been, but I compromised with my conscience by reducing still
further my meagre expenses.</p>
<p>Must I tell how I did so?</p>
<p>Although it was the month of July there was a snap of cold
weather such as sometimes comes in the middle of our English
summer, and yet I gave up having a fire in my room, and for the
cooking of my food I bought a small spirit stove which cost me a
shilling.</p>
<p>This tempted me to conduct which has since had consequences, and
I am half ashamed and half afraid to speak of it. My baby linen
being little I had to wash it frequently, and having no fire I . .
. dried it on my own body.</p>
<p>Oh, I see now it was reckless foolishness, almost wilful
madness, but I thought nothing of it then. I was poor and perhaps I
was proud, and I could not afford a fire. And then a mother's love
is as deep as the sea, and there was nothing in the wide world I
would not have done to keep my darling a little longer beside
me.</p>
<p>Baby being weaned at last I had next to think of a nurse, and
that was a still more painful ordeal. To give my child to another
woman, who was to be the same as a second mother to her, was almost
more than I could bear to think about.</p>
<p>I <i>had</i> to think of it. But I could only do so by telling
myself that, when I put baby out to nurse, I might arrange to see
her every morning and evening and as often as my employment
permitted.</p>
<p>This idea partly reconciled me to my sacrifice, and I was in
the act of drawing up a newspaper advertisement in these terms when
my landlady came to say that the nurse knew of somebody who would
suit me exactly.</p>
<p>Nurse called the same evening and told me a long story about her
friend.</p>
<p>She was a Mrs. Oliver, and she lived at Ilford, which was at the
other end of London and quite on the edge of the country. The poor
woman, who was not too happily married, had lost a child of her own
lately, and was now very lonely, being devoted to children.</p>
<p>This pleased me extremely, especially (God forgive me!), the
fact that Mrs. Oliver was a bereaved mother and lived on the edge
of the country.</p>
<p>Already in my mind's eye I saw her sitting on sunny days under a
tree (perhaps in an orchard) with Isabel in her arms, rocking her
gently and singing to her softly, and almost forgetting that she
was not her own baby whom she had lost . . . though that was a
two-edged sword which cut me both ways, being a sort of wild joy
with tears lurking behind it.</p>
<p>So I took a note of Mrs. Oliver's address (10 Lennard's Row,
Lennard's Green, Ilford) and wrote to her the same night, asking
her terms and stating my own conditions.</p>
<p>A reply came the following day. It was a badly-written and
misspelt letter, which showed me that Mrs. Oliver must be a working
woman (perhaps the wife of a gardener or farm-labourer, I thought),
though that did not trouble me in the least, knowing by this time
how poor people loved their children.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p><i>"The terms is fore shillins a weke," she wrote, "but i am
that lonelie sins my own littel one lef me i wood tike your swete
darling for nothin if I cud afford it and you can cum to see her as
offen as you pleas</i>."</p>
</div>
<p>In my ignorance and simplicity this captured me completely, so I
replied at once saying I would take baby to Ilford the next
day.</p>
<p>I did all this in a rush, but when it came to the last moment I
could scarcely part with my letter, and I remember that I passed
three pillar-boxes in the front street before I could bring myself
to post it.</p>
<p>I suppose my eyes must have been red when I returned home, for
my Welsh landlady (whom I had taken into my confidence about my
means) took me to task for crying, telling me that I ought to thank
God for what had happened, which was like a message from heaven,
look you, and a dispensation of Providence.</p>
<p>I tried to see things in that light, though it was difficult to
do so, for the darker my prospects grew the more radiant shone the
light of the little angel by whose life I lived, and the harder it
seemed to live without her.</p>
<p>"But it isn't like losing my child altogether, is it?" I
said.</p>
<p>"'Deed no, and 'twill he better for both of you," said my
landlady.</p>
<p>"Although Ilford is a long way off I can go there every day,
can't I'!"</p>
<p>"'Deed thee can, if thee'st not minding a journey of nine miles
or more."</p>
<p>"And if I can get a good situation and earn a little money I may
be able to have baby back and hire somebody to nurse her, and so
keep her all to myself."</p>
<p>"And why shouldn't thee?" said my Welsh landlady. "Thee reading
print like the young minister and writing letters like a
copybook!"</p>
<p>So in the fierce bravery of motherly love I dried my eyes and
forced back my sobs, and began to pack up my baby's clothes, and to
persuade myself that I was still quite happy.</p>
<p>My purse was very low by this time. After paying my rent and
some other expenses I had only one pound and a few shillings
left.</p>

<h2><a name="NINETY_SECOND_CHAPTER" id=
"NINETY_SECOND_CHAPTER"></a>NINETY-SECOND CHAPTER</h2>
<p>At half past seven next morning I was ready to start on my
journey.</p>
<p>I took a hasty glance at myself in the glass before going out,
and I thought my eyes were too much like the sky at
daybreak&mdash;all joyful beams with a veil of mist in front of
them.</p>
<p>But I made myself believe that never since baby was born had I
been so happy. I was sure I was doing the best for her. I was also
sure I was doing the best for myself, for what could be so sweet to
a mother as providing for her child?</p>
<p>My Welsh landlady had told me it was nine miles to Ilford, and I
had gathered that I could ride all the way in successive omnibuses
for less than a shilling. But shillings were scarce with me then,
so I determined to walk all the way.</p>
<p>Emmerjane, by her own urgent entreaty, carried baby as far as
the corner of the Bayswater Road, and there the premature little
woman left me, after nearly smothering baby with kisses.</p>
<p>"Keep straight as a' arrow and you can't lose your wye," she
said.</p>
<p>It was one of those beautiful mornings in late July when the air
is fresh and the sun is soft, and the summer, even in London, has
not yet had time to grow tired and dusty.</p>
<p>I felt as light as the air itself. I had put baby's
feeding-bottle in my pocket and hung her surplus linen in a parcel
about my wrist, so I had nothing to carry in my arms except baby
herself, and at first I did not feel her weight.</p>
<p>There were not many people in the West-End streets at that early
hour, yet a few were riding in the Park, and when I came to the
large houses in Lancaster Gate I saw that though the sun was
shining on the windows most of the blinds were down.</p>
<p>I must have been walking slowly, for it was half past eight when
I reached the Marble Arch. There I encountered the first cross-tide
of traffic, but somebody, seeing baby, took me by the arm and led
me safely over.</p>
<p>The great "Mediterranean of Oxford Street" was by this time
running at full tide. People were pouring out of the Tube and
Underground stations and clambering on to the motor-buses. But in
the rush nobody hustled or jostled me. A woman with a child in her
arms was like a queen&mdash;everybody made way for her.</p>
<p>Once or twice I stopped to look at the shops. Some of the
dressmakers' windows were full of beautiful costumes. I did not
covet any of them. I remembered the costly ones I had bought in
Cairo and how little happiness they had brought me. And then I felt
as if the wealth of the world were in my arms.</p>
<p>Nevertheless the whole feminine soul in me awoke when I came
upon a shop for the sale of babies' clothes. Already I foresaw a
time when baby, dressed in pretty things like these, would be
running about Lennard's Green and plucking up the flowers in Mrs.
Oliver's garden.</p>
<p>The great street was very long and I thought it would never end.
But I think I must have been still fresh and happy while we passed
through the foreign quarter of Soho, for I remember that, when two
young Italian waiters, standing at the door of their caf&eacute;,
asked each other in their own language which of us (baby or I) was
"the bambino," I turned to them and smiled.</p>
<p>Before I came to Chancery Lane, however, baby began to cry for
her food, and I was glad to slip down a narrow alley into Lincoln's
Inn Fields and sit on a seat in the garden while I gave her the
bottle. It was then ten o'clock, the sun was high and the day was
becoming hot.</p>
<p>The languid stillness of the garden after the noise and stir of
the streets tempted me to stay longer than I had intended, and when
I resumed my journey I thought the rest must have done me good, but
before I reached the Holborn Viaduct fatigue was beginning to gain
on me.</p>
<p>I saw that I must be approaching some great hospital, for
hospital nurses were now passing me constantly, and one of them,
who was going my way, stepped up and asked me to allow her to carry
baby. She looked so sweet and motherly that I let her do so, and as
we walked along we talked.</p>
<p>She asked me if I was going far, and I said no, only to the
other end of London, the edge of the country, to Ilford.</p>
<p>"Ilford!" she cried. "Why, that's miles and miles away. You'll
have to 'bus it to Aldgate, then change for Bow, and then tram it
through Stratford Market."</p>
<p>I told her I preferred to walk, being such a good walker, and
she gave me a searching look, but said no more on that subject.</p>
<p>Then she asked me how old baby was and whether I was nursing her
myself, and I answered that baby was six weeks and I had been
forced to wean her, being supposed to be delicate, and besides . .
.</p>
<p>"Ah, perhaps you are putting her out to nurse," she said, and I
answered yes, and that was the reason I was going to Ilford.</p>
<p>"I see," she said, with another searching look, and then it
flashed upon me that she had formed her own conclusions about what
had befallen me.</p>
<p>When we came to a great building in a side street on the left,
with ambulance vans passing in and out of a wide gateway, she said
she was sorry she could not carry baby any further, because she was
due in the hospital, where the house-doctor would be waiting for
her.</p>
<p>"But I hope baby's nurse will be a good one. They're not always
that, you know."</p>
<p>I was not quite so happy when the hospital nurse left me. The
parcel on my wrist was feeling heavier than before, and my feet
were beginning to drag. But I tried to keep a good heart as I faced
the crowded thoroughfares&mdash;Newgate with its cruel old prison,
the edge of St. Paul's, and the corner of St. Martin's-le-Grand,
and so on into Cheapside.</p>
<p>Cheapside itself was almost impassable. Merchants, brokers,
clerks, and city men generally in tall silk hats were hurrying and
sometimes running along the pavement, making me think of the river
by my father's house, whose myriad little waves seemed to my fancy
as a child to be always struggling to find out which could get to
Murphy's Mouth the first and so drown itself in the sea.</p>
<p>People were still very kind to me, though, and if anybody
brushed me in passing he raised his hat; and if any one pushed me
accidentally he stopped to say he was sorry.</p>
<p>Of course baby was the talisman that protected me from harm; and
what I should have done without her when I got to the Mansion house
I do not know, for that seemed to be the central heart of all the
London traffic, with its motor-buses and taxi-cabs going in
different directions and its tremendous tides of human life flowing
every way.</p>
<p>But just as I was standing, dazed and deafened on the edge of a
triangle of streets, looking up at a great building that was like a
rock on the edge of a noisy sea, and bore on its face the startling
inscription, "The Earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof," a
big policeman, seeing me with baby in my arms, held up his hand to
the drivers and shouted to the pedestrians ("Stand a-one side,
please"), and then led me safely across, as if the Red Sea had
parted to let us pass.</p>
<p>It was then twelve o'clock and baby was once more crying for her
food, so I looked for a place in which I might rest while I gave
her the bottle again.</p>
<p>Suddenly I came upon what I wanted. It seemed to be a garden,
but it was a graveyard&mdash;one of the graveyards of the old
London churches, enclosed by high buildings now, and overlooked by
office windows.</p>
<p>Such a restful place, so green, so calm, so beautiful! Lying
there in the midst of the tumultuous London traffic, it reminded me
of one of the little islands in the middle of our Ellan glens, on
which the fuchsia and wild rose grow while the river rolls and
boils about it.</p>
<p>I had just sat down on a seat that had been built about a
gnarled and blackened old tree, and was giving baby her food, when
I saw that a young girl was sitting beside me.</p>
<p>She was about nineteen years of age, and was eating scones out
of a confectioner's bag, while she read a paper-covered novel.
Presently she looked at baby with her little eyes, which were like
a pair of shiny boot buttons, and said:</p>
<p>"That your child?"</p>
<p>I answered her, and then she asked:</p>
<p>"Do you like children?"</p>
<p>I answered her again, and asked her if she did not like them
also.</p>
<p>"Can't say I'm particularly gone on them," she said, whereupon I
replied that that was probably because she had not yet had much
experience.</p>
<p>"Oh, haven't I? Perhaps I haven't," she said, and then with a
hard little laugh, she added "Mother's had nine though."</p>
<p>I asked if she was a shop assistant, and with a toss of her head
she told me she was a typist.</p>
<p>"Better screw and your evenings off," she said, and then she
returned to the subject of children.</p>
<p>One of her chums in the office who used to go out with her every
night to the music-halls got into trouble a year or two ago. As a
consequence she had to marry. And what was the result? Never had
her nose out of the wash-tub now!</p>
<p>The story was crude enough, yet it touched me closely.</p>
<p>"But couldn't she have put her baby out to nurse and get another
situation somewhere?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Matter o' luck," said the girl. "Some can. Some can't. That's
their look out. Firms don't like it. If they find you've got a
child they gen'r'lly chuck you."</p>
<p>In spite of myself I was a little down when I started on my
journey again. I thought the parcel was cutting my wrist and I felt
my feet growing heavier at every step.</p>
<p>Was Maggie Jones's story the universal one?</p>
<p>If a child were born beyond the legal limits, was it a thing to
hide away and be ashamed of?</p>
<p>And could it be possible that man's law was stronger than God's
law after all?</p>

<h2><a name="NINETY_THIRD_CHAPTER" id=
"NINETY_THIRD_CHAPTER"></a>NINETY-THIRD CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I had walked so slowly and stopped so often that it was two
o'clock in the afternoon when I passed through Aldgate.</p>
<p>I was then faint for want of food, so I looked out for a
tea-shop or restaurant.</p>
<p>I passed several such places before I found the modest house I
wanted. Then I stepped into it rather nervously and took the seat
nearest the door.</p>
<p>It was an oblong room with red plush seats along the walls
behind a line of marble-topped tables. The customers were all men,
chiefly clerks and warehousemen, I thought, and the attendants were
girls in black frocks and white aprons.</p>
<p>There seemed to be a constant fire of free-and-easy flirtation
going on between them. At one table a man in a cloth cap was saying
to the girl who had served him:</p>
<p>"What's the damage, dearie?"</p>
<p>"One roast, one veg, two breads&mdash;'levenpence, and no
liberties, mister."</p>
<p>"Sunday off, Em'ly?" said a youth in a red tie at another table,
and being told it was, he said:</p>
<p>"Then what do you say to 'oppin' up to 'Endon and 'aving a day
in a boat?"</p>
<p>I had to wait some time before anybody came to attend to me, but
at length a girl from the other end of the room, who had taken no
part in these amatory exchanges, stepped up and asked what I
wanted.</p>
<p>I ordered a glass of cold milk and a scone for myself and a pint
of hot milk to replenish baby's bottle.</p>
<p>The girl served me immediately, and after rinsing and refilling
the feeding-bottle she stood near while the baby used it.</p>
<p>She had quiet eyes and that indefinable expression of yearning
tenderness which we sometimes see in the eyes of a dear old maid
who has missed her motherhood.</p>
<p>The shop had been clearing rapidly; and as soon as the men were
gone, and while the other girls were sitting in corners to read
penny novelettes, my waitress leaned over and asked me if I did not
wish to go into the private room to attend to baby.</p>
<p>A moment afterwards I followed her into a small apartment at the
end of the shop, and there a curious thing occurred.</p>
<p>She closed the door behind us and asked me in an eager whisper
to allow her to see to baby.</p>
<p>I tried to excuse myself, but she whispered:</p>
<p>"Hush! I have a baby of my own, though they know nothing about
it here, so you can safely trust me."</p>
<p>I did so, and it was beautiful to see the joy she had in doing
what was wanted, saying all sorts of sweet and gentle things to my
baby (though I knew they were meant for her own), as if the starved
mother-heart in her were stealing a moment of maternal
tenderness.</p>
<p>"There!" she said, "She'll be comfortable now, bless her!"</p>
<p>I asked about her own child, and, coming close and speaking in a
whisper, she told me all about it.</p>
<p>It was a girl and it would be a year old at Christmas. At first
she had put it out to nurse in town, where she could see it every
evening, but the foster-mother had neglected it, and the inspector
had complained, so she had been compelled to take it away. Now it
was in a Home in the country, ten miles from Liverpool Street, and
it was as bonny as a peach and as happy as the day is long.</p>
<p>"See," she whispered, taking a card from her breast, after a
furtive glance towards the door. "I sent two shillings to have her
photograph taken and the Matron has just sent it."</p>
<p>It was the picture of a beautiful baby girl, and I found it easy
to praise her.</p>
<p>"I suppose you see her constantly, don't you?" I said.</p>
<p>The girl's face dropped.</p>
<p>"Only on visiting days, once a month, and not always that," she
answered.</p>
<p>"But how can you live without seeing her oftener?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Matter o' means," she said sadly. "I pay five shillings a week
for her board, and the train is one-and-eight return, so I have to
be careful, you see, and if I lost my place what would happen to
baby?"</p>
<p>I was very low and tired and down when I resumed my walk. But
when I thought for a moment of taking omnibuses for the rest of my
journey I remembered the waitress's story and told myself that the
little I had belonged to my child, and so I struggled on.</p>
<p>But what a weary march it was during the next two hours! I was
in the East End now, and remembering the splendour of the West, I
could scarcely believe I was still in London.</p>
<p>Long, mean, monotonous streets, running off to right and left,
miles on miles of them without form or feature, or any trace of
nature except the blue strips of sky overhead.</p>
<p>Such multitudes of people, often badly dressed and generally
with set and anxious faces, hasting to and fro, hustling, elbowing,
jostling each other along, as if driven by some invisible power
that was swinging an unseen scourge.</p>
<p>No gracious courtesy here! A woman with a child in her arms was
no longer a queen. Children were cheap, and sometimes it was as
much as I could do to save myself from being pushed off the
pavement.</p>
<p>The air seemed to smell of nothing but ale and coarse tobacco.
And then the noise! The ceaseless clatter of carts, the clang of
electric cars, the piercing shrieks of the Underground Railway
coming at intervals out of the bowels of the earth like explosions
out of a volcano, and, above all, the raucous, rasping,
high-pitched voices of the people, often foul-mouthed, sometimes
profane, too frequently obscene.</p>
<p>A cold, grey, joyless, outcast city, cut off from the rest of
London by an invisible barrier more formidable than a wall; a city
in which the inhabitants seemed to live cold, grey, joyless lives,
all the same that they joked and laughed; a city under perpetual
siege, the siege of Poverty, in the constant throes of civil war,
the War of Want, the daily and hourly fight for food.</p>
<p>If there were other parts of the East End (and I am sure there
must be) where people live simple, natural, human lives, I did not
see them that day, for my course was down the principal
thoroughfares only.</p>
<p>Those thoroughfares, telescoping each other, one after another,
seemed as if they would never come to an end.</p>
<p>How tired I was! Even baby was no longer light, and the parcel
on my wrist had become as heavy as lead.</p>
<p>Towards four o'clock I came to a broad parapet which had strips
of garden enclosed by railings and iron seats in front of them.
Utterly exhausted, my arms aching and my legs limp, I sank into one
of these seats, feeling that I could walk no farther.</p>
<p>But after a while I felt better, and then I became aware that
another woman was sitting beside me.</p>
<p>When I looked at her first I thought I had never in my life seen
anything so repulsive. She was asleep, and having that
expressionless look which sleep gives, I found it impossible to
know whether she was young or old. She was not merely coarse, she
was gross. The womanhood in her seemed to be effaced, and I thought
she was utterly brutalised and degraded.</p>
<p>Presently baby, who had also been asleep, awoke and cried, and
then the woman opened her eyes and looked at the child, while I
hushed her to sleep again.</p>
<p>There must be something in a baby's face that has a miraculous
effect on every woman (as if these sweet angels, fresh from God,
make us all young and all beautiful), and it was even so at that
moment.</p>
<p>Never shall I forget the transfiguration in the woman's face
when she looked into the face of my baby. The expression of
brutality and degradation disappeared, and through the bleared eyes
and over the coarsened features there came the light of an almost
celestial smile.</p>
<p>After a while the woman spoke to me. She spoke in a husky voice
which seemed to be compounded of the effects of rum and raw night
air.</p>
<p>"That your'n," she said.</p>
<p>I answered her.</p>
<p>"Boy or gel?"</p>
<p>I told her.</p>
<p>"'Ow old?"</p>
<p>I told her that too.</p>
<p>The woman was silent for a moment, and then, with a thickening
of the husky voice, she said:</p>
<p>"S'pose you'll say I'm a bleedin' liar, but I 'ad a kid as putty
as that onct&mdash;puttier. It was a boy. The nobbiest little
b&mdash;&mdash; as you ever come acrost. Your'n is putty, but it
ain't in it with my Billie, not by a long chalk."</p>
<p>I asked her what had become of her child.</p>
<p>"Lawst 'im," she said. "Used to give sixpence a week to the
woman what 'ad 'alf the 'ouse with me to look after 'im while I was
workin' at the fact'ry. But what did the bleedin' b&mdash;&mdash;
do? Blimey, if she didn't let 'im get run over by the dray from the
brewery."</p>
<p>"Killed?" I said, clutching at baby.</p>
<p>The woman nodded without speaking.</p>
<p>I asked her how old her child had been.</p>
<p>"More'n four," she said. "Just old enough to run a arrand. It
was crool. Hit me out, I can tell you. That kid was all I had.
Apple o' my eye, in a manner of speakin'. When it was gone there
wasn't much encouragement, was there? The Favver from the Mission
came jawin' as 'ow Jesus 'ad taken 'im to 'Imself. Rot! When they
put 'im down in old Bow I didn't care no more for nothin'. Monse
and monse I walked about night and day, and the bleedin' coppers
was allus on to me. They got their own way at last. I took the
pneumonier and was laid up at the London. And when I got out I
didn't go back to the fact'ry neither."</p>
<p>"What did you do?" I asked.</p>
<p>The woman laughed&mdash;bitterly, terribly.</p>
<p>"Do? Don't you <i>know</i>?"</p>
<p>I shook my head. The woman looked hard at me, and then at the
child.</p>
<p>"Look here&mdash;are you a good gel?" she said.</p>
<p>Hardly knowing what she meant I answered that I hoped so</p>
<p>"'Ope? Don't you know <i>that</i> neither?"</p>
<p>Then I caught her meaning, and answered faintly:</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>She looked searchingly into my eyes and said:</p>
<p>"I b'lieve you. Some gels is. S'elp me Gawd I don't know how
they done it, though."</p>
<p>I was shuddering and trembling, for I was catching glimpses, as
if by broken lights from hell, of the life behind&mdash;the wrecked
hope, the shattered faith, the human being hunted like a beast and
at last turned into one.</p>
<p>Just at that moment baby awoke and cried again. The woman looked
at her with the same look as before&mdash;not so much a smile as a
sort of haggard radiance.</p>
<p>Then leaning over me she blew puffs of alcoholic breath into
baby's face, and stretching out a coarse fat finger she tickled her
under the chin.</p>
<p>Baby ceased to cry and began to smile. Seeing this the woman's
eyes sparkled like sunshine.</p>
<p>"See that," she cried. "S'elp me Jesus, I b'lieve I could 'ave
been good meself if I'd on'y 'ad somethink like this to keer
for."</p>
<p>I am not ashamed to say that more than once there had been tears
in my eyes while the woman spoke, though her blasphemies had
corrupted the air like the gases that rise from a dust-heap. But
when she touched my child I shuddered as if something out of the
'lowest depths had tainted her.</p>
<p>Then a strange thing happened.</p>
<p>I had risen to go, although my limbs could scarcely support me,
and was folding my little angel closely in my arms, when the woman
rose too and said:</p>
<p>"You wouldn't let me carry your kiddie a bit, would you?"</p>
<p>I tried to excuse myself, saying something, I know not what The
woman looked at me again, and after a moment she said:</p>
<p>"S'pose not. On'y I thought it might make me think as 'ow I was
carryin' Billie."</p>
<p>That swept down everything.</p>
<p>The one remaining window of the woman's soul was open and I
dared not close it.</p>
<p>I looked down at my child&mdash;so pure, so sweet, so stainless;
I looked up at the woman&mdash;so foul, so gross, so degraded.</p>
<p>There was a moment of awful struggle and then . . . the woman
and I were walking side by side.</p>
<p>And the harlot was carrying my baby down the street.</p>

<p>At five o'clock I was once more alone.</p>
<p>I was then standing (with baby in my own arms now) under the
statue which is at the back of Bow Church.</p>
<p>I thought I could walk no farther, and although every penny I
had in my pocket belonged to Isabel (being all that yet stood
between her and want) I must borrow a little of it if she was to
reach Mrs. Oliver's that night.</p>
<p>I waited for the first tram that was going in my direction, and
when it came up I signalled to it, but it did not stop&mdash;it was
full.</p>
<p>I waited for a second tram, but that was still more crowded.</p>
<p>I reproached myself for having come so far. I told myself how
ill-advised I had been in seeking for a nurse for my child at the
farthest end of the city. I reminded myself that I could not hope
to visit her every day if my employment was to be in the West, as I
had always thought it would be. I asked myself if in all this vast
London, with its myriads of homes, there had been no house nearer
that could have sheltered my child.</p>
<p>Against all this I had to set something, or I think my very
heart would have died there and then. I set the thought of Ilford,
on the edge of the country, with its green fields and its flowers.
I set the thought of Mrs. Oliver, who would love my child as
tenderly as if she were her own little lost one.</p>
<p>I dare say it was all very weak and childish, but it is just
when we are done and down, and do not know what we are doing, that
Providence seems to be directing us, and it was so with me at that
moment.</p>
<p>The trams being full I had concluded that Fate had set itself
against my spending any of Isabel's money, and had made up my mind
to make a fierce fight over the last stage of my journey, when I
saw that a little ahead of where I was standing the road divided
into two branches at an acute angle, one branch going to the right
and the other to the left.</p>
<p>Not all Emmerjane's instructions about keeping "as straight as
a' arrow" sufficed to show me which of the two roads to take and I
looked about for somebody to tell me.</p>
<p>It was then that I became aware of a shabby old four-wheeled cab
which stood in the triangular space in front of the statue, and of
the driver (an old man, in a long coachman's coat, much worn and
discoloured, and a dilapidated tall hat, very shiny in patches)
looking at me while he took the nose-bag off his horse&mdash;a bony
old thing with its head hanging down.</p>
<p>I stepped up to him and asked my way, and he pointed it out to
me&mdash;to the right, over the bridge and through Stratford
Market.</p>
<p>I asked how far it was to Ilford.</p>
<p>"Better nor two mile <i>I</i> call it," he answered.</p>
<p>After that, being so tired in brain as well as body, I asked a
foolish question&mdash;how long it would take me to get there.</p>
<p>The old driver looked at me again, and said:</p>
<p>"'Bout a 'our and a 'alf I should say by the looks of
you&mdash;and you carryin' the biby."</p>
<p>I dare say my face dropped sadly as I turned away, feeling very
tired, yet determined to struggle through. But hardly had I walked
twenty paces when I heard the cab coming up behind and the old
driver crying:</p>
<p>"'Old on, missie."</p>
<p>I stopped, and to my surprise he drew up by my side, got down
from his box, opened the door of his cab and said:</p>
<p>"Ger in."</p>
<p>I told him I could not afford to ride.</p>
<p>"Ger in," he said again more loudly, and as if angry with
himself for having to say it.</p>
<p>Again I made some demur, and then the old man said, speaking
fiercely through his grizzly beard:</p>
<p>"Look 'ere, missie. I 'ave a gel o' my own lost somewheres, and
I wouldn't be ans'rable to my ole woman if I let you walk with a
face like that."</p>
<p>I don't know what I said to him. I only know that my tears
gushed out and that at the next moment I was sitting in the
cab.</p>
<p>What happened then I do not remember, except that the dull
rumble of the wheels told me we were passing over a bridge, and
that I saw through the mist before my eyes a sluggish river, a
muddy canal, and patches of marshy fields.</p>
<p>I think my weariness and perhaps my emotion, added to the heavy
monotonous trotting of the old horse, must have put me to sleep,
for after a while I was conscious of a great deal of noise, and of
the old driver twisting about and shouting in a cheerful voice
through the open window at the back of his seat:</p>
<p>"Stratford Market."</p>
<p>After a while we came to a broad road, full of good houses, and
then the old driver cried "Ilford," and asked what part of it I
wished to go to.</p>
<p>I reached forward and told him, "10 Lennard's Row, Lennard's
Green," and then sat back with a lighter heart.</p>
<p>But after another little while I saw a great many funeral cars
passing us, with the hearses empty, as if returning from a
cemetery. This made me think of the woman and her story, and I
found myself unconsciously clasping my baby closer.</p>
<p>The cort&egrave;ges became so numerous at last that to shut out
painful sights I closed my eyes and tried to think of pleasanter
things.</p>
<p>I thought, above all, of Mrs. Oliver's house, as I had always
seen it in my mind's eye&mdash;not a pretentious place at all, only
a little humble cottage but very sweet and clean, covered with
creepers and perhaps with roses.</p>
<p>I was still occupied with these visions when I felt the cab turn
sharply to the left. Then opening my eyes I saw that we were
running down a kind of alley-way, with a row of very mean little
two-storey houses on the one side, and on the other, a kind of
waste ground strewn with broken bottles, broken iron pans, broken
earthenware and other refuse, interspersed with tufts of long
scraggy grass, which looked the more wretched because the sinking
sun was glistening over it.</p>
<p>Suddenly the cab slowed down and stopped. Then the old man
jumped from his box and opening his cab door, said:</p>
<p>"Here you are, missie. This is your destingnation."</p>
<p>There must have been a moment of semi-consciousness in which I
got out of the cab, for when I came to full possession of myself I
was standing on a narrow pavement in front of a closed door which
bore the number 10.</p>
<p>At first I was stunned. Then my heart was in my mouth and it was
as much as I could do not to burst out crying. Finally I wanted to
fly, and I turned back to the cab, but it had gone and was already
passing round the corner.</p>
<p>It was six o'clock. I was very tired. I was nine miles from
Bayswater. I could not possibly carry baby back. What <i>could</i>
I do?</p>
<p>Then, my brain being unable to think, a mystic feeling (born
perhaps of my life in the convent) came over me&mdash;a feeling
that all that had happened on my long journey, all I had seen and
everything that had been said to me, had been intended to prepare
me for (and perhaps to save me from) the dangers that were to
come.</p>
<p>I think that gave me a certain courage, for with what strength
of body and spirit I had left (though my heart was in my mouth
still) I stepped across the pavement and knocked at the door.</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM BY MARTIN CONRAD</p>
<p>My great-hearted, heroic little woman!</p>
<p>All this time I, in my vain belief that our expedition was of
some consequence to the world, was trying to comfort myself with
the thought that my darling must have heard of my safety.</p>
<p>But how could I imagine that she had hidden herself away in a
mass of humanity&mdash;which appears to be the most impenetrable
depths into which a human being can disappear?</p>
<p>How could I dream that, to the exclusion of all such interests
as mine, she was occupied day and night, night and day, with the
joys and sorrows, the raptures and fears of the mighty passion of
Motherhood, which seems to be the only thing in life that is really
great and eternal?</p>
<p>Above all, how could I believe that in London itself, in the
heart of the civilised and religious world, she was going through
trials which make mine, in the grim darkness of the Polar night,
seem trivial and easy?</p>
<p>It is all over now, and though, thank God, I did not know at the
time what was happening to my dear one at home, it is some comfort
to me to remember that I was acting exactly as if I did.</p>
<p>From the day we turned hack I heard my darling's voice no more.
But I had a still more perplexing and tormenting experience, and
that was a dream about her, in which she was walking on a crevassed
glacier towards a precipice which she could not see because the
brilliant rays of the aurora were in her eyes.</p>
<p>Anybody may make what he likes of that on grounds of natural
law, and certainly it was not surprising that my dreams should
speak to me in pictures drawn from the perils of my daily life, but
only one thing matters now&mdash;that these experiences of my
sleeping hours increased my eagerness to get back to my dear
one.</p>
<p>My comrades were no impediment to that, I can tell you. With
their faces turned homewards, and the wind at their backs, they
were showing tremendous staying power, although we had thirty and
forty below zero pretty constantly, with rough going all the time,
for the snow had been ruckled up by the blizzard to almost
impassable heaps and hummocks.</p>
<p>On reaching our second installation at Mount Darwin I sent a
message to the men at the foot of Mount Erebus, telling them to get
into communication (through Macquarie Island) with the captain of
our ship in New Zealand, asking him to return for us as soon as the
ice conditions would permit; and this was the last of our jobs
(except packing our instruments tight and warm) before we started
down the "long white gateway" for our quarters at the Cape.</p>
<p>With all the heart in the world, though, our going had to be
slow. It was the middle of the Antarctic winter, when absolute
night reigned for weeks and we had nothing to alleviate the
darkness but the light of the scudding moon, and sometimes the
glory of the aurora as it encircled the region of the unrisen
sun.</p>
<p>Nevertheless my comrades sang their way home through the sullen
gloom. Sometimes I wakened the echoes of those desolate old hills
myself with a stave of "Sally's the gel," although I was suffering
a good deal from my darker thoughts of what the damnable
hypocrisies of life might be doing with my darling, and my desire
to take my share of her trouble whatever it might be.</p>
<p>The sun returned the second week in August. Nobody can know what
relief that brought us except those who have lived for months
without it. To see the divine and wonderful thing rise up like a
god over those lone white regions is to know what a puny thing man
is in the scheme of the world.</p>
<p>I think all of us felt like that at sight of the sun, though
some (myself among the rest) were thinking more of it as a kind of
message from friends at home. But old Treacle, I remember, who had
stood looking at it in awed solemnity, said:</p>
<p>"Well, I'm d&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>
<p>After that we got on famously until we reached Winter Quarters,
where we found everybody well and everything in order, but received
one piece of alarming intelligence&mdash;that the attempt to get
into wireless communication with our ship had failed, with the
result that we should have to wait for her until the time
originally appointed for her return.</p>
<p>That did not seem to matter much to my shipmates, who, being
snugly housed from blinding blizzards, settled down to amuse
themselves with sing-songs and story-tellings and readings.</p>
<p>But, do what I would, to me the delay was dreadful, and every
day, in the fever of my anxiety to get away as soon as the ice
permitted, I climbed the slopes of old Erebus with O'Sullivan, to
look through powerful glasses for what the good chap called the
"open wather."</p>
<p>Thank God, our wooden house was large enough to admit of my
having a cabin to myself, for I should have been ashamed of my
comrades hearing the cries that sometimes burst from me in the
night.</p>
<p>It is hard for civilised men at home, accustomed to hold
themselves under control, to realise how a man's mind can run away
from him when he is thousands of miles separated from his dear
ones, and has a kind of spiritual certainty that evil is befalling
them.</p>
<p>I don't think I am a bigger fool than most men in that way, but
I shiver even yet at the memory of all the torment I went through
during those days of waiting, for my whole life seemed to revolve
before me and I accused myself of a thousand offences which I had
thought dead and buried and forgotten.</p>
<p>Some of these were trivial in themselves, such as hot and
intemperate words spoken in childhood to my good old people at
home, disobedience or ingratitude shown to them, with all the usual
actions of a naughty boy, who ought to have been spanked and never
was.</p>
<p>But the worst of them concerned my darling, and came with the
thought of my responsibility for the situation in which I felt sure
she found herself.</p>
<p>A thousand times I took myself to task for that, thinking what I
ought and ought not to have done, and then giving myself every bad
name and my conduct every damning epithet.</p>
<p>Up and down my cabin I would walk with hands buried in my
pockets, revolving these thoughts and working myself up, against my
will, to a fever of regret and self-accusation.</p>
<p>Talk about Purgatory&mdash;the Purgatory of dear old Father Dan!
That was to come after death&mdash;mine came before, and by the
holy saints, I had enough of it.</p>
<p>Two months passed like this; and when the water of the Sound was
open and our ship did not appear, mine was not the only heart that
was eating itself out, for the spirits of my shipmates had also
begun to sink.</p>
<p>In the early part of the Antarctic spring there had been a
fearful hurricane lasting three days on the sea, with a shrieking,
roaring chorus of fiends outside, and the conviction now forced
itself on my men that our ship must have gone down in the
storm.</p>
<p>Of course I fought this notion hard, for my last hopes were
based on not believing it. But when after the lapse of weeks I
could hold out no longer, and we were confronted by the possibility
of being held there another year (for how were our friends to know
before the ice formed again that it was necessary to send relief?),
I faced the situation firmly&mdash;measuring out our food and
putting the men on shortened rations, twenty-eight ounces each and
a thimbleful of brandy.</p>
<p>By the Lord God it is a fearful thing to stand face to face with
slow death. Some of my shipmates could scarcely bear it. The utter
solitude, the sight of the same faces and the sound of the same
voices, with the prospect of nothing else, seemed to drive most of
them nearly mad.</p>
<p>There was no sing-songing among them now, and what speaking I
overheard was generally about the great dinners they had eaten, or
about their dreams, which were usually of green fields and
flower-beds and primroses and daisies&mdash;daisies, by heaven, in
a world that was like a waste!</p>
<p>As for me I did my best to play the game of never giving up. It
was a middling hard game, God knows, and after weeks of waiting a
sense of helplessness settled down on me such as I had never known
before.</p>
<p>I am not what is called a religious man, but when I thought of
my darling's danger (for such I was sure it was) and how I was cut
off from her by thousands of miles of impassable sea, there came an
overwhelming longing to go with my troubles to somebody stronger
than myself.</p>
<p>I found it hard to do that at first, for a feeling of shame came
over me, and I thought:</p>
<p>"You coward, you forgot all about God when things were going
well with you, but now that they are tumbling down, and death seems
certain, you whine and want to go where you never dreamt of going
in your days of ease and strength."</p>
<p>I got over that, though&mdash;there's nothing except death a man
doesn't get over down there&mdash;and a dark night came when (the
ice breaking from the cliffs of the Cape with a sound that made me
think of my last evening at Castle Raa) I found myself folding my
hands and praying to the God of my childhood, not for myself but
for my dear one, that He before whom the strongest of humanity were
nothing at all, would take her into His Fatherly keeping.</p>
<p>"Help her! Help her! <i>I</i> can do no more."</p>
<p>It was just when I was down to that extremity that it pleased
Providence to come to my relief. The very next morning I was
awakened out of my broken sleep by the sound of a gun, followed by
such a yell from Treacle as was enough to make you think the
sea-serpent had got hold of his old buttocks.</p>
<p>"The ship! The ship! Commander! Commander! The ship! The
ship!"</p>
<p>And, looking out of my little window I saw him, with six or
seven other members of our company, half naked, just as they had
leapt out of their bunks, running like savages to the edge of the
sea, where the "Scotia," with all flags flying (God bless and
preserve her!), was steaming slowly up through a grinding pack of
broken ice.</p>
<p>What a day that was! What shouting! What hand-shaking! For
O'Sullivan it was Donnybrook Fair with the tail of his coat left
out, and for Treacle it was Whitechapel Road with "What cheer, old
cock?" and an unquenchable desire to stand treat all round.</p>
<p>But what I chiefly remember is that the moment I awoke, and
before the idea that we were saved and about to go home had been
fully grasped by my hazy brain, the thought flashed to my mind:</p>
<p>"Now you'll hear of <i>her!</i>"</p>

<h2><a name="NINETY_FIFTH_CHAPTER" id=
"NINETY_FIFTH_CHAPTER"></a>NINETY-FIFTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>The door of No. 10 was opened by a rather uncomely woman of
perhaps thirty years of age, with a weak face and watery eyes.</p>
<p>This was Mrs. Oliver, and it occurred to me even at that first
sight that she had the frightened and evasive look of a wife who
lives under the intimidation of a tyrannical husband.</p>
<p>She welcomed me, however, with a warmth that partly dispelled my
depression and I followed her into the kitchen.</p>
<p>It was the only room on the ground floor of her house (except a
scullery) and it seemed sweet and clean and comfortable, having a
table in the middle of the floor, a sofa under the window, a
rocking-chair on one side of the fireplace, a swinging baby's cot
on the other side, and nothing about it that was not homelike and
reassuring, except two large photographs over the mantelpiece of
men stripped to the waist and sparring.</p>
<p>"We've been looking for you all day, ma'am, and had nearly give
you up," she said.</p>
<p>Then she took baby out of my arms, removed her bonnet and
pelisse, lifted her barrow-coat to examine her limbs, asked her
age, kissed her on the arms, the neck and the legs, and praised her
without measure.</p>
<p>"And what's her name, ma'am?"</p>
<p>"Mary Isabel, but I wish her to be called Isabel."</p>
<p>"Isabel! A beautiful name too! Fit for a angel, ma'am. And she
<i>is</i> a little angel, bless her! Such rosy cheeks! Such a ducky
little mouth! Such blue eyes&mdash;blue as the bluebells in the
cemet'ry. She's as pretty as a waxwork, she really is, and any
woman in the world might be proud to nurse her."</p>
<p>A young mother is such a weakling that praise of her child
(however crude) acts like a charm on her, and in spite of myself I
was beginning to feel more at ease, when Mrs. Oliver's husband came
downstairs.</p>
<p>He was a short, thick-set man of about thirty-five, with a
square chin, a very thick neck and a close-cropped red bullet head,
and he was in his stocking feet and shirt-sleeves as if he had been
dressing to go out for the evening.</p>
<p>I remember that it flashed upon me&mdash;I don't know
why&mdash;that he had seen me from the window of the room upstairs,
driving up in the old man's four-wheeler, and had drawn from that
innocent circumstance certain deductions about my character and my
capacity to pay.</p>
<p>I must have been right, for as soon as our introduction was over
and I had interrupted Mrs. Oliver's praises of my baby's beauty by
speaking about material matters, saying the terms were to be four
shillings, the man, who had seated himself on the sofa to put on
his boots said, in a voice that was like a shot out of a
blunderbus:</p>
<p>"Five."</p>
<p>"How'd you mean, Ted?" said Mrs. Oliver, timidly. "Didn't we say
four?"</p>
<p>"Five," said the man again, with a still louder volume of
voice.</p>
<p>I could see that the poor woman was trembling, but assuming the
sweet air of persons who live in a constant state of fear, she
said:</p>
<p>"Oh yes. It <i>was</i> five, now I remember."</p>
<p>I reminded her that her letter had said four, but she insisted
that I must be mistaken, and when I told her I had the letter with
me and she could see it if she wished, she said:</p>
<p>"Then it must have been a slip of the pen in a manner of
speaking, ma'am. We allus talked of five. Didn't we, Ted?"</p>
<p>"Certainly," said her husband, who was still busy with his
boots.</p>
<p>I saw what was going on, and I felt hot and angry, but there
seemed to be nothing to do except submit.</p>
<p>"Very well, we'll say five then," I said.</p>
<p>"Paid in advance," said the man, and when I answered that that
would suit me very well, he added:</p>
<p>"A month in advance, you know."</p>
<p>By this time I felt myself trembling with indignation, as well
as quivering with fear, for while I looked upon all the money I
possessed as belonging to baby, to part with almost the whole of it
in one moment would reduce me to utter helplessness, so I said,
turning to Mrs. Oliver:</p>
<p>"Is that usual?"</p>
<p>It did not escape me that the unhappy woman was constantly
studying her husband's face, and when he glanced up at her with a
meaning look she answered, hurriedly:</p>
<p>"Oh yes, ma'am, quite usual. All the women in the Row has it.
Number five, she has twins and gets a month in hand with both of
them. But we'll take four weeks and I can't say no fairer than
that, can I?"</p>
<p>"But why?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Well, you see, ma'am, you're . . . you're a stranger to us, and
if baby was left on our hands . . . Not as we think you'd leave her
chargeable as the saying is, but if you were ever ill, and got a
bit back with your payments . . . we being only pore people. . .
."</p>
<p>While the poor woman was floundering on in this way my blood was
boiling and I was beginning to ask her if she supposed for one
moment that I meant to desert my child, when the man, who had
finished the lacing of his boots, rose to his feet, and said:</p>
<p>"You don't want yer baiby to be give over to the Guardians for
the sake of a week or two, do you?"</p>
<p>That settled everything. I took out my purse and with a
trembling hand laid my last precious sovereign on the table.</p>
<p>A moment or two after this Mr. Oliver, who had put on his coat
and a cloth cap, made for the door.</p>
<p>"Evenin', ma'am," he said, and with what grace I could muster I
bade him good-bye.</p>
<p>"You aren't a-going to the 'Sun' to-night, are you, Ted?" asked
Mrs. Oliver.</p>
<p>"Club," said the man, and the door clashed behind him.</p>
<p>I breathed more freely when he was gone, and his wife (from
whose face the look of fear vanished instantly) was like another
woman.</p>
<p>"Goodness gracious," she cried, with a kind of haggard hilarity,
"where's my head? Me never offering you a cup of tea, and you
looking so white after your journey."</p>
<p>I took baby back into my arms while she put on the kettle, set a
black tea-pot on the hob to warm, laid a piece of tablecloth and a
thick cup and saucer on the end of the table, and then knelt on the
fender to toast a little bread, talking meantime (half
apologetically and half proudly) about her husband.</p>
<p>He was a bricklayer by trade, and sometimes worked at the
cemetery which I could see at the other side of the road (behind
the long railings and the tall trees), but was more generally
engaged as a sort of fighting lieutenant to a Labour leader whose
business it was to get up strikes. Before they were married he had
been the "Light Weight Champion of Whitechapel," and those were
photos of his fights which I could see over the mantelpiece, but
"he never did no knocking of people about now," being "quiet and
matrimonual."</p>
<p>In spite of myself my heart warmed to the woman. I wonder it did
not occur to me there and then that, living in constant dread of
her tyrannical husband, she would always be guilty of the
dissimulation I had seen an example of already and that the effect
of it would be reflected upon my child.</p>
<p>It did not. I only told myself that she was clearly fond of
children and would be a kind nurse to my baby. It even pleased me,
in my foolish motherly selfishness, that she was a plain-featured
person, whom baby could never come to love as she would, I was
sure, love me.</p>
<p>I felt better after I had taken tea, and as it was then seven
o'clock, and the sun was setting horizontally through the cypresses
of the cemetery, I knew it was time to go.</p>
<p>I could not do that, though, without undressing baby and singing
her to sleep. And even then I sat for a while with an aching heart,
and Isabel on my knee, thinking of how I should have to go to bed
that night, for the first time, without her.</p>
<p>Mrs. Oliver, in the meantime, examining the surplus linen which
I had brought in my parcel, was bursting into whispered cries of
delight over it, and, being told I had made the clothes myself, was
saying:</p>
<p>"What a wonderful seamstress you might be if you liked,
ma'am."</p>
<p>At length the time came to leave baby, and no woman knows the
pain of that experience who has not gone through it.</p>
<p>Though I really believed my darling would be loved and cared
for, and knew she would never miss me, or yet know that I was gone
(there was a pang even in that thought, and in every other kind of
comforting), I could not help it, that, as I was putting my cherub
into her cot, my tears rained down on her little face and awakened
her, so that I had to kneel by her side and rock her to sleep
again.</p>
<p>"You'll be good to my child, won't you, Mrs. Oliver?" I
said.</p>
<p>"'Deed I will, ma'am," the woman replied.</p>
<p>"You'll bath her every day, will you not?"</p>
<p>"Night and morning. I allus does, ma'am."</p>
<p>"And rinse out her bottle and see that she has nice new milk
fresh from the cow?"</p>
<p>"Sure as sure, ma'am. But don't you fret no more about the
child, ma'am. I've been a mother myself, ma'am, and I'll be as good
to your little angel as if she was my own come back to me."</p>
<p>"God bless you," I said in a burst of anguish, and after
remaining a moment longer on my knees by the cot (speaking with all
my heart and soul, though neither to nurse nor to baby) I rose to
my feet, dashed the tears from my eyes, and ran out of the
house.</p>

<h2><a name="NINETY_SIXTH_CHAPTER" id=
"NINETY_SIXTH_CHAPTER"></a>NINETY-SIXTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I knew that my eyes were not fit to be seen in the streets, so I
dropped my dark veil and hurried along, being conscious of nothing
for some time except the clang of electric cars and the bustle of
passers-by, to whom my poor little sorrow was nothing at all.</p>
<p>But I had not gone far&mdash;I think I had not, though my senses
were confused and vague&mdash;before I began to feel ashamed, to
take myself to task, and to ask what I had to cry about.</p>
<p>If I had parted from my baby it was for her own good, and if I
had paid away my last sovereign I had provided for her for a month,
I had nothing to think of now except myself and how to get
work.</p>
<p>I never doubted that I should get work, or that I should get it
immediately, the only open question being what work and where.</p>
<p>Hitherto I had thought that, being quick with my pen, I might
perhaps become secretary to somebody; but now, remembering the
typist's story ("firms don't like it"), and wishing to run no risks
in respect of my child, I put that expectation away and began to
soar to higher things.</p>
<p>How vain they were! Remembering some kind words the Reverend
Mother had said about me at the convent (where I had taken more
prizes than Alma, though I had never mentioned it before) I told
myself that I, too, was an educated woman. I knew Italian, French
and German, and having heard that some women could make a living by
translating books for publishers I thought I might do the same.</p>
<p>Nay, I could even write books myself. I was sure I
could&mdash;one book at all events, about friendless girls who have
to face the world for themselves, and all good women would read it
(some good men also), because they would see that it must be
true.</p>
<p>Oh, how vain were my thoughts! Yet in another sense they were
not all vanity, for I was not thinking of fame, or what people
would say about what I should write, but only what I should get for
it.</p>
<p>I should get money, not a great deal perhaps, yet enough for
baby and me, that we might have that cottage in the country,
covered with creepers and roses, where Isabel would run about the
grass by and by, and pluck the flowers in the garden.</p>
<p>"So what have <i>you</i> got to cry about, you ridiculous
thing," I thought while I hurried along, with a high step now, as
if my soul had been in my feet.</p>
<p>But a mother's visions of the future are like a mirage (always
gleaming with the fairy palaces which her child is to inhabit some
day), and I am not the first to find her shadows fade away.</p>
<p>I must have been walking for some time, feeling no weariness at
all, when I came to the bridge by Bow Church. There I had intended
to take a tram, but not being tired I went on farther, thinking
every stage I could walk would be so much money to the good.</p>
<p>I was deep in the Mile End Road, when a chilling thought came to
me. It was the thought of the distance that would divide me from my
child, making my visits to her difficult, and putting it out of my
power to reach her quickly (perhaps even to know in time) if, as
happened to children, she became suddenly and dangerously ill.</p>
<p>I remembered the long line of telescoping thoroughfares I had
passed through earlier in the day (with their big hospitals, their
big breweries, their big tabernacles, their workmen's
lodging-houses, their Cinema picture palaces, their Jewish
theatres, and their numberless public houses); and then the barrier
of squalid space which would divide me from baby, if I obtained
employment in the West End, seemed to be immeasurably greater and
more frightening than the space that had divided me from Martin
when he was at the other end of the world.</p>
<p>Not all the allurements of my dream were sufficient to reconcile
me to such a dangerous separation.</p>
<p>"It's impossible," I thought. "Quite impossible."</p>
<p>Insensibly my rapid footsteps slackened. When I reached that
part of the Mile End Road in which the Jewish tailors live, and
found myself listening to a foreign language which I afterwards
knew to be Yiddish, and looking at men with curls at each side of
their sallow faces, slithering along as if they were wearing
eastern slippers without heels, I stopped, without knowing why, at
the corner of a street where an Italian organ-man was playing while
a number of bright-eyed Jewish children danced.</p>
<p>I was still looking on, hardly thinking of what I saw, when my
eyes fell on an advertisement, pasted on the window of a
sausage-and-ham shop at the corner. In large written characters it
ran:</p>
<p><i>Seamstress Wanted. Good Wages.<br />
Apply No. &mdash;&mdash; Washington Street</i>.</p>
<p>How little are the things on which our destiny seems to hang! In
a moment I was remembering what Mrs. Oliver had said about my being
a good seamstress; and, almost before I knew what I was about, I
was hurrying up the side street and knocking with my knuckles at an
open door.</p>
<p>A rather fat and elderly Jewess, covered with rings and gold
chains, and wearing a manifest black wig, came from a room at one
side of the lobby. I explained my errand, and after she had looked
me over in a sort of surprise, as if I had not been the kind of
person she expected, she said, in a nasal and guttural voice:</p>
<p>"Vait! My daughter, she speaks very vell Ainglish."</p>
<p>Then turning her head over her shoulder, she pitched her voice
several octaves higher and cried, "Miriam," whereupon there came
tripping downstairs a Jewish girl of about eighteen, with large
black eyes, thick black hair, and such a dear good face.</p>
<p>I repeated my application, and after the girl had interpreted my
request to her mother, I was asked into the lobby, and put through
a kind of catechism.</p>
<p>Was I a seamstress? No, but I wished to become one. Had I aiver
vorked on vaistcoats? I hadn't, but I could do anything with my
needle.</p>
<p>Perhaps the urgency of my appeal, and more probably the pressure
of her own need, weighed with the Jewess, for after reflection, and
an eager whisper from her daughter (who was looking at me with
kindling eyes), she said,</p>
<p>"Very vell, ve'll see what she can do."</p>
<p>I was then taken into a close and stuffy room where a number of
girls (all Jewish as I could see) were working on sections of
waistcoats which, lying about on every side, looked like patterns
for legs of mutton. One girl was basting, another was pressing, and
a third was sewing button-holes with a fine silk twist round bars
of gimp.</p>
<p>This last was the work which was required of me, and I was told
to look and see if I could do it. I watched the girl for a moment
and then said:</p>
<p>"Let me try."</p>
<p>Needle and twist and one of the half vests were then given to
me, and after ten minutes I had worked my first button-hole and
handed it back.</p>
<p>The daughter praised it warmly, but the mother said:</p>
<p>"Very fair, but a leedle slow."</p>
<p>"Let me try again," I said, and my trembling fingers were so
eager to please that my next button-hole was not only better but
more quickly made.</p>
<p>"Beautiful!" said the daughter. "And mamma, only think, she's
quicker than Leah, already. I timed them."</p>
<p>"I muz call your vader, dough," said the Jewess, and she
disappeared through the doorway.</p>
<p>While I stood talking to the younger Jewess, who had, I could
see, formed as quick an attachment for me as I for her, I heard
another nasal and guttural voice (a man's) coming towards us from
the hall.</p>
<p>"Is she von of our people?"</p>
<p>"Nein! She's a Skihoah"&mdash;meaning, as I afterwards learned,
a non-Jewish girl.</p>
<p>Then a tall, thin Jew entered the room behind the elderly
Jewess. I had never before and have never since seen such a
patriarchal figure. With his long grey beard and solemn face he
might have stood for Moses in one of the pictures that used to hang
on the walls of the convent&mdash;except for his velvet skull-cap
and the black alpaca apron, which was speckled over with fluffy
bits of thread and scraps of cloth and silk.</p>
<p>He looked at me for a moment with his keen eyes, and after his
wife had shown him my work, and he had taken a pinch of snuff and
blown his nose on a coloured handkerchief with the sound of a
trumpet, he put me through another catechism.</p>
<p>I was trembling lest he should make intimate inquiries, but
beyond asking my name, and whether I was a Christian, he did not
concern himself with personal questions.</p>
<p>"Vat vages do you vant?" he asked.</p>
<p>I told him I should be pleased to take whatever was paid to
other girls doing work of the same kind.</p>
<p>"Ach no! Dese girls are full-timers. You are only a greener
[meaning a beginner] so you vill not expect anything like so
much."</p>
<p>At that his daughter repeated her assurance that I was quicker
than the girl she had called Leah; but the Jew, with an air of
parental majesty, told her to be silent, and then said that as I
was an "improver" he could only take me "on piece," naming the
price (a very small one) per half-dozen buttons and buttonholes,
with the condition that I found my own twist and did the work in my
own home.</p>
<p>Seeing that I should be no match for the Jew at a bargain, and
being so eager to get to work at any price, I closed with his
offer, and then he left the room, after telling me to come back the
next day.</p>
<p>"And vhere do you lif, my dear?" said the Jewess.</p>
<p>I told her Bayswater, making some excuse for being in the East
End, and getting as near to the truth as I dare venture, but
feeling instinctively, after my sight of the master of the house,
that I dared say nothing about my child.</p>
<p>She told me I must live nearer to my work, and I said that was
exactly what I wished to do&mdash;asking if she knew where I could
find a room.</p>
<p>Fortunately the Jewess herself had two rooms vacant at that
moment, and we went upstairs to look at them.</p>
<p>Both were at the top of the house, and one of them I could have
for two shillings a week, but it was dark and cheerless, being at
the back and looking into the space over the yards in which the
tenants dried their washing on lines stretched from pulleys.</p>
<p>The other, which would cost a shilling a week more, was a lean
slit of a room, very sparsely furnished, but it was to the front,
and looked down into the varied life of the street, so I took it
instantly and asked when I could move in.</p>
<p>"Ven you like," said the Jewess. "Everyding is ready."</p>
<p>So, early next morning I bade farewell to my good Welsh landlady
(who looked grave when I told her what I was going to do) and to
Emmerjane (who cried when I kissed her smudgy face) and, taking
possession of my new home, began work immediately in my first and
only employment.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was a deep decline after the splendours of my dreams,
but I did not allow myself to think about that. I was near to
Ilford and I could go to see Isabel every day.</p>
<p>Isabel! Isabel! Isabel! Everything was Isabel, for now that
Martin was gone my hopes and my fears, my love and my life,
revolved on one axis only&mdash;my child.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="NINETY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"NINETY_SEVENTH_CHAPTER"></a>NINETY-SEVENTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>My employer was a Polish Jew, named Israel Abramovitch.</p>
<p>He had come to England at the time of the religious persecution
in the Holy Cities of Russia, set himself up in his trade as a
tailor in a garret in Whitechapel, hired a "Singer," worked with
"green" labour for "slop" warehouses, and become in less than
twenty years the richest foreign Jew in the East End of London,
doing some of the "best bespoke" work for the large shops in the
West and having the reputation (as I afterwards found) of being the
greatest of Jewish "sweaters."</p>
<p>In spite of this, however, he was in his own way a deeply
religious man. Strict, severe, almost superstitious in obeying the
Levitical laws and in practising the sad and rather gloomy
symbolism of his faith. A famous Talmudist, a pillar of the
synagogue, one of the two wardens of the Chevra in Brick Lane, and
consequently a great upholder of moral rectitude.</p>
<p>His house seemed to be a solid mass of human beings, chiefly
Jewish girls, who worked all day, and sometimes (when regulations
could be evaded or double gangs engaged) all night, for the Jew
drove everybody at high speed, not excepting his wife, who cooked
the food and pressed the clothes at the same time.</p>
<p>In this hive of industry I needed no spur to make me work.</p>
<p>Every morning Mrs. Abramovitch brought up a thick pile of vests
to my room, and every evening she took them down again, after
counting my earnings with almost preternatural rapidity and paying
me, day by day, with unfailing promptitude.</p>
<p>At the end of my first week I found I had made ten shillings. I
was delighted, but after I had paid for my room and my food there
was not enough for baby's board, so the second week I worked later
in the evenings, and earned fourteen shillings. This was still
insufficient, therefore I determined to take something from the
other end of the day.</p>
<p>"Morning will be better," I thought, remembering the painful
noises at night, especially about midnight, when people were being
thrown out of a public-house higher up the street, where there was
a placard in the window saying the ale sold there could be
guaranteed to "make anybody drunk for fourpence."</p>
<p>Unfortunately (being a little weak) I was always heavy in the
mornings, but by great luck my room faced the east, so I conceived
the idea of moving my bed up to the window and drawing my blinds to
the top so that the earliest light might fall on my face and waken
me.</p>
<p>This device succeeded splendidly, and for many weeks of the late
summer and early autumn I was up before the sun, as soon as the
dawn had broadened and while the leaden London daylight was
filtering through the smoke of yesterday.</p>
<p>By this means I increased my earnings to sixteen shillings, and,
as my fingers learned to fly over their work, to seventeen and even
eighteen.</p>
<p>That was my maximum, and though it left a narrow margin for
other needs it enabled me at the end of a month to pay another
pound for baby's board and to put away a little towards her
"shortening," which Mrs. Oliver was always saying must be soon.</p>
<p>I had to stick close to maintain this average, and I grudged
even the time occupied in buying and eating my food, though that
was not a long process in the Mile End Road, which is full of shops
where things can be bought ready cooked. After the first week I did
not even need to go out for them, for they were brought round to my
room every morning, thus enabling me to live without leaving my
work.</p>
<p>It was a stiff life, perhaps, but let nobody think I looked upon
myself as a slave. Though I worked so hard I felt no self-pity. The
thought that I was working for my child sweetened all my labours.
It was such a joy to think that baby depended upon me for
everything she wanted.</p>
<p>Being so happy in those days I sang a great deal, though
naturally not in the middle of the day, when our house was going
like a mill-wheel, but in the early mornings before the electric
trams began to clang, or the hawkers with their barrows to shout,
and when there was no sound even in the East End except that
ceaseless tramp, tramp, tramp in the front street which always made
me think of the children of Israel in Egypt drawing burdens for
Pharaoh.</p>
<p>Throwing open my window I sang all sorts of things, but, being
such a child myself and so fond of make-believe, I loved best to
sing my lullaby, and so pretend that baby was with me in my room,
lying asleep behind me in my bed.</p>
<p>"<i>Sleep, little baby, I love thee, I love thee,<br />
Sleep, little Queen, I am bending above thee</i>."</p>
<p>I never knew that I had any other audience than a lark in a cage
on the other side of the street (perhaps I was in a cage myself,
though I did not think of that then) which always started singing
when I sang, except the washerwomen from a Women's Shelter going
off at four to their work at the West End, and two old widows
opposite who sewed Bibles and stitched cassocks, which being (so
Miriam told me) the worst-paid of all sweated labour compelled them
to be up as early as myself.</p>
<p>It was not a very hopeful environment, yet for some time, in my
little top room, I was really happy.</p>
<p>I saw baby every day. Between six and nine every night, I broke
off work to go to Ilford, saying nothing about my errand to
anybody, and leaving the family of the Jew to think it was my time
for recreation.</p>
<p>Generally I "trammed" it from Bow Church, because I was so eager
to get to my journey's end, but usually I returned on foot, for
though the distance was great I thought I slept better for the
walk.</p>
<p>What joyful evenings those were!</p>
<p>Perhaps I was not altogether satisfied about the Olivers, but
that did not matter very much. On closer acquaintance I found my
baby's nurse to be a "heedless" and "feckless" woman; and though I
told myself that all allowances must be made for her in having a
bad husband, I knew in my secret heart that I was deceiving myself,
and that I ought to listen to the voices that were saying "Your
child is being neglected."</p>
<p>Sometimes it seemed to me that baby had not been
bathed&mdash;but that only gave me an excuse for bathing her
myself.</p>
<p>Sometimes I thought her clothes were not as clean as they might
be&mdash;but that only gave me the joy of washing them.</p>
<p>Sometimes I was sure that her feeding-bottle had not been rinsed
and her milk was not quite fresh&mdash;but that only gave me the
pleasure of scalding the one and boiling the other.</p>
<p>More than once it flashed upon me that I was paying Mrs. Oliver
to do all this&mdash;but then what a deep delight it was to be
mothering my own baby!</p>
<p>Thus weeks and months passed&mdash;it is only now I know how
many, for in those days Time itself had nothing in it for me except
my child&mdash;and every new day brought the new joy of watching my
baby's development.</p>
<p>Oh, how wonderful it all was! To see her little mind and soul
coming out of the Unknown! Out of the silence and darkness of the
womb into the world of light and sound!</p>
<p>First her sense of sight, with her never-ending interest in her
dear little toes! Then her senses of touch and hearing, and the
gift of speech, beginning with a sort of crow, and ending in the
"ma-ma-ma" which the first time I heard it went prancing through
and through me and was more heavenly to my ears than the music of
the spheres!</p>
<p>What evenings of joy I had with her!</p>
<p>The best of them (God forgive me!) were the nights when the
bricklayer had got into some trouble by "knocking people about" at
the "Rising Sun" and his wife had to go off to rescue him from the
police.</p>
<p>Then, baby being "shortened," I would prop her up in her cot
while I sang "Sally" to her; or if that did not serve, and her
little lip continued to drop, I both sang and danced, spreading my
skirts and waltzing to the tune of "Clementina" while the kettle
hummed over the fire and the bricklayer's kitchen buzzed softly
like a hive of bees.</p>
<p>Oh dear! Oh dear! I may have been down in the depths, yet there
is no place so dark that it may not be brightened by a sunbeam, and
my sunbeam was my child.</p>
<p>And then Martin&mdash;baby was constantly making me think of
him. Devouring her with my eyes, I caught resemblances every
day&mdash;in her eyes, her voice, her smile, and, above all, in
that gurgling laugh that was like water bubbling out of a
bottle.</p>
<p>I used to talk to her about him, pouring all my sentimental
secrets into her ears, just as if she understood, telling her what
a great man her father had been and how he loved both of
us&mdash;<i>would</i> have done if he had lived longer.</p>
<p>I dare say it was very foolish. Yet I cannot think it was all
foolishness. Many and many a time since I have wondered if the holy
saints, who knew what had really happened to Martin, were
whispering all this in my ear as a means of keeping my love for him
as much alive as if he had been constantly by my side.</p>
<p>The climax came when Isabel was about five months old, for then
the feeling about baby and Martin reached another and higher
phase.</p>
<p>I hardly dare to speak of it, lest it should seem silly when it
was really so sacred and so exalted.</p>
<p>The idea I had had before baby was born, that she was being sent
to console me (to be a link between my lost one and me), developed
into the startling and rapturous thought that the very soul of
Martin had passed into my child.</p>
<p>"So Martin is not dead at all," I thought, "not really dead,
because he lives in baby."</p>
<p>It is impossible to say how this thought stirred me; how it
filled my heart with thankfulness; how I prayed that the little
body in which the soul of my Martin had come to dwell might grow
beautiful and strong and worthy of him; how I felt charged with
another and still greater responsibility to guard and protect her
with my life itself if need be.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, my very life itself," I thought.</p>
<p>Perhaps this was a sort of delirium, born of my great love, my
hard work, and my failing strength. I did not know, I did not
care.</p>
<p>All that mattered to me then was one thing only&mdash;that
whereas hitherto I had thought Martin was so far gone from me that
not Time but only Eternity would bring us together, now I felt that
he was coming back and back to me&mdash;nearer and nearer and
nearer every day.</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM BY MARTIN CONRAD</p>
<p>My dear, noble little woman was right in more ways than she
knew.</p>
<p>At that very time I was in literal truth hurrying home to her as
fast as the fastest available vessel could carry me.</p>
<p>As soon as we had boarded the <i>Scotia</i> at the Cape and
greeted our old shipmates, we shouted for our letters.</p>
<p>There were some for all of us and heaps for me, so I scuttled
down to my cabin, where I sorted the envelopes like a pack of
cards, looking for the small delicate hand that used to write my
letters and speeches.</p>
<p>To my dismay it was not there, and realizing that fact I bundled
the letters into a locker and never looked at them again until we
were two days out&mdash;when I found they were chiefly
congratulations from my committee, the proprietor of my newspaper,
and the Royal Geographical Society, all welcome enough in their
way, but Dead Sea fruit to a man with an empty, heaving heart.</p>
<p>Going up on deck I found every face about me shining like the
aurora, for the men had had good news all round, one having come
into a fortune and another into the fatherhood of twins, and both
being in a state of joy and excitement.</p>
<p>But all the good fellows were like boys. Some of them (with
laughter seasoned by a few tears) read me funny bits out of their
wives' letters&mdash;bits too that were not funny, about having "a
pretty fit of hysterics" at reading bad news of us and "wanting to
kiss the newsboy" when he brought the paper contradicting it.</p>
<p>I did my best to play the game of rejoicing, pretending I had
had good news also, and everything was going splendid. But I found
it hard enough to keep it going, especially while we were sailing
back to the world, as we called it, and hearing from the crew the
news of what had happened while we had been away.</p>
<p>First, there was the reason for the delay in the arrival of the
ship, which had been due not to failure of the wireless at our end,
but to a breakdown on Macquarie Island.</p>
<p>And then there was the account of the report of the loss of the
<i>Scotia</i> in the gale going out, which had been believed on
insufficient evidence (as I thought), but recorded in generous
words of regret that sent the blood boiling to a man's face and
made him wish to heaven they could be true.</p>
<p>We were only five or six days sailing to New Zealand, but the
strain to me was terrible, for the thought was always
uppermost:</p>
<p>"Why didn't she write a word of welcome to reach me on my return
to civilisation?"</p>
<p>When I was not talking to somebody that question was constantly
haunting me. To escape from it I joined the sports of my shipmates,
who with joyful news in their hearts and fresh food in their
stomachs were feeling as good as new in spite of all they had
suffered.</p>
<p>But the morning we smelt land, the morning the cloud banks above
the eastern horizon came out hard and fast and sure (no dreamland
this time), I stood at the ship's bow, saying nothing to anybody,
only straining my eyes for the yet distant world we were coming
back to out of that desolate white waste, and thinking:</p>
<p>"Surely I'll have news from her before nightfall."</p>
<p>There was a big warm-hearted crowd on the pier at Port
Lyttelton. Treacle said, "Gawd. I didn't know there was so many
people in the world, Guv'nor;" and O'Sullivan, catching sight of a
pretty figure under a sunshade, tugged at my arm and cried (in the
voice of an astronomer who has discovered a planet), "Commanther!
Commanther! A <i>girl!</i>"</p>
<p>Almost before we had been brought to, a company of scientific
visitors came aboard; but I was more concerned about the telegrams
that had come at the same moment, so hurrying down to my cabin I
tore them open like a vulture riving its prey&mdash;always looking
at the signatures first and never touching an envelope without
thinking:</p>
<p>"Oh God, what will be inside of it?"</p>
<p>There was nothing from my dear one! Invitations to dine, to
lecture, to write books, to do this and that and Heaven knows what,
but never a word from her who was more to me than all the world
besides.</p>
<p>This made me more than ever sure of the "voices" that had called
me back from the 88th latitude, so I decided instantly to leave our
ship in New Zealand, in readiness for our next effort, and getting
across to Sydney to take the first fast steamer home.</p>
<p>The good people at Port Lyttelton were loath to let us go. But
after I had made my excuses, ("crazy to get back to wives and
sweethearts, you know") they sent a school of boys (stunning little
chaps in Eton suits) to sing us off with "Forty Years
On"&mdash;which brought more of my mother into my eyes than I knew
to be left there.</p>
<p>At Sydney we had the same experience&mdash;the same hearty
crowds, the same welcome, the same invitations, to which we made
the same replies, and then got away by a fast liner which happened
to be ready to sail.</p>
<p>On the way "back to the world" I had slung together a sort of a
despatch for the newspaper which had promoted our expedition (a
lame, limping thing for want of my darling's help to make it go),
saying something about the little we had been able to do but more
about what we meant, please God, to do some day.</p>
<p>"She'll see that, anyway, and know we're coming back," I
thought.</p>
<p>But to make doubly sure I sent two personal telegrams, one to my
dear one at Castle Raa and the other to my old people at home,
asking for answers to Port Said.</p>
<p>Out on the sea again I was tormented by the old dream of the
crevassed glacier; and if anybody wonders why a hulking chap who
had not been afraid of a ninety-mile blizzard in the region of the
Pole allowed himself to be kept awake at night by a buzzing in the
brain, all I can say is that it was so, and I know nothing more
about it.</p>
<p>Perhaps my recent experience with the "wireless" persuaded me
that if two sticks stuck in the earth could be made to communicate
with each other over hundreds of miles, two hearts that loved each
other knew no limitations of time or space.</p>
<p>In any case I was now so sure that my dear one had called me
home from the Antarctic that by the time we reached Port Said, and
telegrams were pouring in on me, I had worked myself up to such a
fear that I dared not open them.</p>
<p>From sheer dread of the joy or sorrow that might be enclosed in
the yellow covers, I got O'Sullivan down in my cabin to read my
telegrams, while I scanned his face and nearly choked with my own
tobacco smoke.</p>
<p>There was nothing from my dear one! Nothing from my people at
home either!</p>
<p>O'Sullivan got it into his head that I was worrying about my
parents, and tried to comfort me by saying that old folks never
dreamt of telegraphing, but by the holy immaculate Mother he'd go
bail there would be a letter for me before long.</p>
<p>There was.</p>
<p>We stayed two eternal days at Port Said while the vessel was
taking coal for the rest of the voyage, and almost at the moment of
sailing a letter arrived from Ellan, which, falling into
O'Sullivan's hands first, sent him flying through the steamer and
shouting at the top of his voice:</p>
<p>"Commanther! Commanther!"</p>
<p>The passengers gave room for him, and told me afterwards of his
beaming face. And when he burst into my cabin I too felt sure he
had brought me good news, which he had, though it was not all that
I wanted.</p>
<p>"The way I was sure there would be a letter for you soon, and by
the holy St. Patrick and St. Thomas, here it is," he cried.</p>
<p>The letter was from my father, and I had to brace myself before
I could read it.</p>
<p>It was full of fatherly love, motherly love, too, and the
extravagant pride my dear good old people had of me ("everybody's
talking of you, my boy, and there's nothing else in the
newspapers"); but not a word about my Mary&mdash;or only one, and
that seemed worse than none at all.</p>
<p>"You must have heard of the trouble at Castle Raa. Very sad, but
this happy hour is not the time to say anything about it."</p>
<p>Nothing more! Only reams and reams of sweet parental chatter
which (God forgive me!) I would have gladly given over and over
again for one plain sentence about my darling.</p>
<p>Being now more than ever sure that some kind of catastrophe had
overtaken my poor little woman, I telegraphed to her again, this
time (without knowing what mischief I was making) at the house of
Daniel O'Neill&mdash;telling myself that, though the man was a
brute who had sacrificed his daughter to his lust of rank and power
and all the rest of his rotten aspirations, he was her father, and,
if her reprobate of a husband had turned her out, he must surely
have taken her in.</p>
<p>"Cable reply to Malta. Altogether too bad not hearing from you,"
I said.</p>
<p>A blind, hasty, cruel telegram, but thank God she never received
it!</p>

"NINETY_EIGHTH_CHAPTER"></a>NINETY-EIGHTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Day by day it became more and more difficult for me to throw
dust in my own eyes about the Olivers.</p>
<p>One evening on reaching their house a little after six, as
usual, I found the front door open, the kitchen empty save for
baby, who, sitting up in her cot, was holding quiet converse with
her toes, and the two Olivers talking loudly (probably by
pre-arrangement) in the room upstairs.</p>
<p>The talk was about baby, which was "a noosance," interfering
with a man's sleep by night and driving him out of his home by day.
And how much did they get for it? Nothing, in a manner of speaking.
What did the woman (meaning me) think the "bleedin' place"
was&mdash;"a philanthropic institooshun" or a "charity orginisation
gime"?</p>
<p>After this I heard the bricklayer thunder downstairs in his
heavy boots and go out of the house without coming into the
kitchen, leaving his wife (moral coward that he was) to settle his
account with me.</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Oliver came down, with many sighs, expressed surprise
at seeing me and fear that I might have overheard what had been
said in the room above.</p>
<p>"Sorry to say I've been having a few words with Ted, ma'am, and
tell you the truth it was about you."</p>
<p>Ted had always been against her nursing, and she must admit it
wasn't wise of a woman to let her man go to the public-house to get
out of the way of a crying child; but though she was a-running
herself off her feet to attend to the pore dear, and milk was up a
penny, she had growd that fond of my baby since she lost her own
that she couldn't abear to part with the jewel, and perhaps if I
could pay a little more&mdash;Ted said seven, but she said six, and
a shilling a week wouldn't hurt me&mdash;she could over-persuade
him to let the dear precious stay.</p>
<p>I was trembling with indignation while I listened to the woman's
whining (knowing well I was being imposed upon), but I was helpless
and so I agreed.</p>
<p>My complacency had a bad effect on the Olivers, who continued to
make fresh extortions, until their demands almost drove me to
despair.</p>
<p>I thought a climax had been reached when one night a neighbour
came to the door and, calling Mrs. Oliver into the lobby,
communicated some news in a whisper which brought her back with a
frightened face for her cloak and hat, saying "something was a
matter with Ted" and she must "run away quick to him."</p>
<p>When she returned an hour or two later she was crying, and with
sobs between her words she told me that Ted (having taken a drop
too much) had "knocked somebody about" at the "Sun." As a
consequence he had fallen into the hands of the police, and would
be brought before the magistrate the following morning, when, being
unable to pay the fine, he would have to "do time"&mdash;just as a
strike was a-coming on, too, and he was expecting good pay from the
Strike Committee.</p>
<p>"And what is to happen to me and the baby while my 'usband is in
prison?" she said.</p>
<p>I knew it was an act of weakness, but, thinking of my child and
the danger of its being homeless, I asked what the amount of the
fine would probably be, and being told ten-and-six, I gave the
money, though it was nearly all I had in the world.</p>
<p>I paid for my weakness, though, and have reason to remember
it.</p>
<p>The extortions of the Olivers had brought me to so narrow a
margin between my earnings and expenses that I lay awake nearly all
that night thinking what I could do to increase the one or reduce
the other. The only thing I found possible was to change to cheaper
quarters. So next morning, with a rather heavy heart, I asked Mrs.
Abramovitch if the room at the back of the house was still empty,
and hearing that it was I moved into it the same day.</p>
<p>That was a small and not a very wise economy.</p>
<p>My new room was cheerless as well as dark, with no sights but
the clothes that were drying from the pulley-lines and no sounds
but the whoops of the boys of the neighbourhood playing at "Red
Indians" on the top of the yard walls.</p>
<p>But it was about the same as the other in size and furniture,
and after I had decorated it with my few treasures&mdash;the
Reverend Mother's rosary, which I hung on the head of the bed, and
my darling mother's miniature, which I pinned up over the
fire&mdash;I thought it looked bright and homelike.</p>
<p>All this time, too, I was between the nether and the upper
mill-stone.</p>
<p>My employer, the Jew (though he must have seen that I was
sweating myself much more than the law would have allowed him to
sweat me), could not forgive himself when he found that I was
earning more by "piece" than he would have had to pay me by the
day, or resist the temptation to square accounts with me at the
earliest possible opportunity.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his opportunity came only too quickly, and it led
(however indirectly) to the most startling fact that has ever,
perhaps, entered into a woman's life.</p>
<p>I had not been more than three months at the Jew's house when
the Jewish festivals came round&mdash;New Year's Day, the Day of
Atonement, and the Feast of Tabernacles&mdash;which, falling near
together and occupying many days, disturbed his own habits of work
entirely.</p>
<p>One of the tasks he reserved for himself was that of taking the
best paid of his "best-bespoke" back to the large shops in the West
End, and waiting for the return orders. But finding that the
festivals interfered with these journeys, he decided that they
should be made by me, who was supposed to know the West End (having
lived in it) and to present a respectable appearance.</p>
<p>I was reluctant to undertake the new duty, for though the Jew
was to pay me a few shillings a week for it, I saw I could earn
more in the time with my needle. But when he laid his long, hairy
forefinger on the side of his nose and said with a significant
smile:</p>
<p>"You vill be gradeful, and convenience your employer, mine
child," I agreed.</p>
<p>Thus it came to pass that not only during the Jewish festivals,
but for months after they were over, I carried a rather large black
bag by tram or rail to the district that lies at the back of
Piccadilly and along Oxford Street as far west as the Marble
Arch.</p>
<p>I had to go whenever called upon and to wait as long as wanted,
so that in the height of the tailoring season I was out in the West
End at all irregular hours of night, and even returned to my
lodgings on one or two occasions in the raw sunshine of the early
mornings.</p>
<p>The one terror of my West End journeys was that I might meet
Sister Mildred. I never did. In the multitude of faces which passed
through the streets, flashing and disappearing like waves under the
moon at sea, I never once caught a glimpse of a face I knew.</p>
<p>But what sights I saw for all that! What piercing, piteous
proofs that between the rich and the poor there is a great gulf
fixed!</p>
<p>The splendid carriages driving in and out of the Park; the
sumptuously dressed ladies strolling through Bond Street; the
fashionable church paraders; the white plumes and diamond stars
which sometimes gleamed behind the glow of the electric broughams
gliding down the Mall.</p>
<p>"I used to be a-toffed up like that onct," I heard an old woman
who was selling matches say as a lady in an ermine coat stepped out
of a theatre into an automobile and was wrapped round in a
tiger-skin rug.</p>
<p>Sometimes it happened that, returning to the East End after the
motor 'buses had ceased to ply, I had to slip through the silent
Leicester Square and the empty Strand to the Underground Railway on
the Embankment.</p>
<p>Then I would see the wretched men and women who were huddled
together in the darkness on the steps to the river (whose
ever-flowing waters must have witnessed so many generations of
human wreckage), and, glancing up at the big hotels and palatial
mansions full of ladies newly returned from theatres and
restaurants in their satin slippers and silk stockings, I would
wonder how they could lie in their white beds at night in rooms
whose windows looked down on such scenes.</p>
<p>But the sight that stirred me most (though it did not awaken my
charity, which shows what a lean-souled thing I was myself) was
that of the "public women," the street-walkers, as I used to call
them, whom I saw in Piccadilly with their fine clothes and painted
faces, sauntering in front of the clubs or tripping along with a
light step and trying to attract the attention of the men.</p>
<p>I found no pathos in the position of such women. On the
contrary, I had an unspeakable horror and hatred and loathing of
them, feeling that no temptation, no poverty, no pressure that
could ever be brought to bear upon a woman in life or in death
excused her for committing so great a wrong on the sanctity of her
sex as to give up her womanhood at any call but that of love.</p>
<p>"Nothing could make me do it," I used to think, "nothing in this
world."</p>
<p>But O God! how little I knew then what is in a woman's heart to
do when she has a child to live for, and is helpless and alone!</p>
<p>I cannot expect anybody to forgive me for what I did (or
attempted to do), and now that the time has come to tell of it my
hand trembles, and body and soul seem to be quivering like a
flame.</p>
<p>May God (who has brought everything to such a glorious end) have
mercy on me and forgive me, and help me to be true!</p>

<h2><a name="NINETY_NINTH_CHAPTER" id=
"NINETY_NINTH_CHAPTER"></a>NINETY-NINTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>The worst consequence of my West End journeys was that my
nightly visits to Ilford were fewer than before, and that the
constant narrowing of the margin between my income and my expenses
made it impossible for me to go there during the day.</p>
<p>As a result my baby received less and less attention, and I
could not be blind to the fact that she was growing paler and
thinner.</p>
<p>At length she developed a cough which troubled me a great deal.
Mrs. Oliver made light of it, saying a few pennyworths of paregoric
would drive it away, so I hurried off to a chemist, who recommended
a soothing syrup of his own, saying it was safer and more effectual
for a child.</p>
<p>The syrup seemed to stop the cough but to disturb the digestion,
for I saw the stain of curdled milk on baby's bib and was conscious
of her increasing weakness.</p>
<p>This alarmed me very much, and little as I knew of children's
ailments, I became convinced that she stood in need of more fresh
air, so I entreated Mrs. Oliver to take her for a walk every
day.</p>
<p>I doubt if she ever did so, for as often as I would say:</p>
<p>"Has baby been out to-day, nurse?" Mrs. Oliver would make some
lame excuse and pass quickly to another subject.</p>
<p>At last, being unable to bear the strain any longer, I burst out
on the woman with bitter reproaches, and then she broke down into
tears and explained everything. She was behind with her rent, the
landlord was threatening, and she dared not leave the house for a
moment lest he should lock her out altogether.</p>
<p>"I don't mind telling you, it's all along of Ted, ma'am. He's on
strike wages but he spends it at the 'Sun.' He has never been the
man to me&mdash;never once since I married him. I could work and
keep the house comfortable without him, but he wouldn't let me
a-be, because he knows I love, him dear. Yes, I do, I love him
dear," she continued, breaking into hysterical sobs, "and if he
came home and killed me I could kiss him with my last breath."</p>
<p>This touched me more than I can say. A sense of something tragic
in the position of the poor woman, who knew the character of the
man she loved as well as the weakness which compelled her to love
him, made me sympathise with her for the first time, and think
(with a shuddering memory of my own marriage) how many millions of
women there must be in the world who were in a worse position than
myself.</p>
<p>On returning to my room that night I began to look about to see
if I had anything I could sell in order to help Mrs. Oliver, and so
put an end to the condition that kept my baby a prisoner in her
house.</p>
<p>I had nothing, or next to nothing. Except the Reverend Mother's
rosary (worth no more than three or four shillings) I had only my
mother's miniature, which was framed in gold and set in pearls, but
that was the most precious of all my earthly possessions except my
child.</p>
<p>Again and again when I looked at it in my darkest hours I had
found new strength and courage. It had been like a shrine to
me&mdash;what the image of the Virgin was in happier days&mdash;and
thinking of all that my darling mother had done and suffered and
sacrificed for my sake when I was myself a child, I felt that I
could never part with her picture under the pressure of any
necessity whatever.</p>
<p>"Never," I thought, "never under any circumstances."</p>
<p>It must have been about a week after this that I went to Ilford
on one of those chill, clammy nights which seem peculiar to the
East End of London, where the atmosphere, compounded of smoke and
fog and thin drizzling rain; penetrates to the bone and hangs on
one's shoulders like a shroud.</p>
<p>Thinking of this, as I thought of everything, in relation to
baby, I bought, as I was passing a hosier's shop, a pair of nice
warm stockings and a little woollen jacket.</p>
<p>When I reached the Olivers' I found, to my surprise, two strange
men stretched out at large in the kitchen, one on the sofa and the
other in the rocking-chair, both smoking strong tobacco and baby
coughing constantly.</p>
<p>Before I realised what had happened Mrs. Oliver called me into
the scullery, and, after closing the door on us, she explained the
position, in whispers broken by sobs.</p>
<p>It was the rent. These were the bailiff's men put into
possession by the landlord, and unless she could find two pounds
ten by nine o'clock to-morrow morning, she and her husband would be
sold up and turned into the street.</p>
<p>"The home as I've been scraping and pinching to keep together!"
she cried. "For the sake of two pound ten! . . . You couldn't lend
us that much, could you?"</p>
<p>I told her I could not, but she renewed her entreaties, asking
me to think if I had not something I could pawn for them, and
saying that Ted and she would consider it "a sacred dooty" to
repay.</p>
<p>Again I told her I had nothing&mdash;I was trying not to think
of the miniature&mdash;but just at that moment she caught sight of
the child's jacket which I was still holding in my hand, and she
fell on me with bitter reproaches.</p>
<p>"You've money enough to spend on baby, though. It's crool. Her
living in lukshry and getting new milk night and day, and fine
clothes being bought for her constant, and my pore Ted without a
roof to cover him in weather same as this. It breaks my heart. It
do indeed. Take your child away, ma'am. Take her to-night, afore
we're turned out of house and home to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>Before the hysterical cries with which Mrs. Oliver said this had
come to an end I was on my way back to my room at the Jew's. But it
was baby I was thinking of in relation to that cold, clammy
night&mdash;that it would be impossible to take her out in it (even
if I had somewhere to take her to, which I had not) without risk to
her health and perhaps her life.</p>
<p>With trembling fingers and an awful pain at my heart I took my
mother's miniature from the wall and wrapped it up in tissue
paper.</p>
<p>A few minutes afterwards I was back in the damp streets, walking
fast and eagerly, cutting over the lines of the electric trams
without looking for the crossings.</p>
<p>I knew where I was going to&mdash;I was going to a pawnbroker's
in the Mile End Waste which I had seen on my West End journeys.
When I got there I stole in at a side door, half-closing my eyes as
I did so, by that strange impulse which causes us to see nothing
when we do not wish to be seen.</p>
<p>I shall never forget the scene inside. I think it must have left
a scar on my brain, for I see it now in every detail&mdash;the
little dark compartment; the high counter; the shelves at the back
full of parcels, like those of a left-luggage room at a railway
station; the heavy, baggy, big-faced man in shirt-sleeves with a
long cigar held between his teeth at the corner of his frothy
mouth; and then my own hurried breathing; my thin fingers opening
the tissue paper and holding out the miniature; the man's coarse
hands fumbling it; his casual air as he looked at it and cheapened
it, as if it had been a common thing scarcely worthy of
consideration.</p>
<p>"What's this 'ere old-fashion'd thing? Portrait of your
great-grandmother? Hum! Not 'arf bad-looking fice, neither."</p>
<p>I think my eyes must have been blazing like hot coals. I am sure
I bit my lips (I felt them damp and knew they were bleeding) to
prevent myself from flinging out at the man in spite of my
necessity. But I did my best to control my trembling mouth, and
when he asked me how much I wanted on the miniature I answered,
with a gulp in my throat:</p>
<p>"Two pounds ten, if you please, sir."</p>
<p>"Couldn't do it," said the pawnbroker.</p>
<p>I stood speechless for a moment, not knowing what to say next,
and then the pawnbroker, with apparent indifference, said:</p>
<p>"I'll give you two ten for it out and out."</p>
<p>"You mean I am to <i>sell</i> . . ."</p>
<p>"Yus, take it or leave it, my dear."</p>
<p>It is no use saying what I suffered at that moment. I think I
became ten years older during the few minutes I stood at that
counter.</p>
<p>But they came to an end somehow, and the next thing I knew was
that I was on my way back to Ilford; that the damp air had deepened
into rain; that miserable and perhaps homeless beings, ill-clad and
ill-fed, were creeping along in the searching cold with that
shuffling sound which bad boots make on a wet pavement; and that I
was telling myself with a fluttering heart that the sheltering
wings of my beautiful mother in heaven had come to cover my
child.</p>
<p>On reaching the Olivers', hot and breathless, I put three gold
coins, two sovereigns and a half-sovereign, on to the table to pay
off the broker's men.</p>
<p>They had been settling themselves for the night, and looked
surprised and I thought chagrined, but took up the money and went
away.</p>
<p>As they were going off one of them called me to the door, and in
the little space at the foot of the stairs he said, tipping his
fingers towards the cot:</p>
<p>"If that's your kiddie, miss, I recommend you to get it out o'
this 'ere place quick&mdash;see?"</p>
<p>I stayed an hour or two longer because I was troubled about
baby's cough; and before I left, being still uneasy, I did what I
had never done before&mdash;wrote my address at the Jew's house, so
that I could be sent for if I was ever wanted.</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDREDTH_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDREDTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDREDTH CHAPTER</h2>
<p>When I awoke next morning the last word of the broker's man
seemed to be ringing in my ears.</p>
<p>I knew it was true; I knew I ought to remove baby from the house
of the Olivers without another day's delay, but I was at a loss to
know what to do with her.</p>
<p>To bring her to my own room at the Jew's was obviously
impossible, and to advertise for a nurse for my child was to run
the risk of falling into the toils of somebody who might do worse
than neglect her.</p>
<p>In my great perplexity I recalled the waitress at the restaurant
whose child had been moved to a Home in the country, and for some
moments I thought how much better it would be that baby should be
"bonny and well" instead of pale and thin as she was now. But when
I reflected that if I took her to a public institution I should see
her only once a month, I told myself that I could not and would not
do so.</p>
<p>"I'll work my fingers to the bone first," I thought.</p>
<p>Yet life makes a fearful tug at a woman when it has once got
hold of her, and, strangely enough, it was in the Jew's house that
I first came to see that for the child's own sake I must part with
her.</p>
<p>Somewhere about the time of my moving into the back room my
employer made a kind of bower of branches and evergreens over the
lead-flat roof of an outhouse in his back-yard&mdash;a Succah, as
Miriam called it, built in honour of the Feast of Tabernacles, as a
symbol of the time when the Israelites in the Wilderness dwelt in
booths.</p>
<p>In this Succah the Jew's family ate all their meals during the
seven or eight days of the Jewish feast, and one morning, as I sat
at work by my open window, I heard Miriam after breakfast reading
something from the Books of Moses.</p>
<p>It was the beautiful story of Jacob parting with Benjamin in the
days of the famine, when there was corn in Egypt only&mdash;how the
poor old father in his great love could not bring himself to give
up his beloved son, although death threatened him; how Judah
pleaded with Jacob to send the boy with him into the far country
lest they should all die, "both we and thou and also our little
ones;" and how at last Jacob said, "If it must be so, do this," but
"if I be bereaved of my children, I am bereaved."</p>
<p>It would be hard to say how deeply this story moved me while I
listened from my room above. And now that I thought of it again, I
saw that I was only sacrificing my child to my selfish love of her,
and therefore the duty of a true mother was to put her into a
Home.</p>
<p>It would not be for long. The work I was doing was not the only
kind I was capable of. After I had liberated myself from the daily
extortions of the Olivers I should be free to look about for more
congenial and profitable employment; and then by and by baby and I
might live together in that sweet cottage in the country (I always
pictured it as a kind of Sunny Lodge, with roses looking in at the
window of "Mary O'Neill's little room") which still shone through
my dreams.</p>
<p>I spent some sleepless nights in reconciling myself to all this,
and perhaps wept a little, too, at the thought that after years of
separation I might be a stranger to my own darling. But at length I
put my faith in "the call of the blood" to tell her she was mine,
and then nothing remained except to select the institution to which
my only love and treasure was to be assigned.</p>
<p>Accident helped me in this as in other things. One day on my
westward journey a woman who sat beside me in the tram, and was
constantly wiping her eyes (though I could see a sort of sunshine
through her tears), could not help telling me, out of the
overflowing of her poor heart, what had just been happening to
her.</p>
<p>She was a widow, and had been leaving her little girl, three
years old, at an orphanage, and though it had been hard to part
with her, and the little darling had looked so pitiful when she
came away, it would be the best for both of them in the long
run.</p>
<p>I asked which orphanage it was, and she mentioned the name of
it, telling me something about the founder&mdash;a good doctor who
had been a father to the fatherless of thousands of poor women like
herself.</p>
<p>That brought me to a quick decision, and the very next morning,
putting on my hat and coat, I set off for the Home, which I knew
where to find, having walked round it on my way back from the West
End and heard the merry voices of happy children who were playing
behind a high wall.</p>
<p>I hardly know whether to laugh or cry when I think of the mood
in which I entered the orphanage. In spite of all that life had
done to me, I really and truly felt as if I were about to confer an
immense favour upon the doctor by allowing him to take care of my
little woman.</p>
<p>Oh, how well I remember that little point of time!</p>
<p>My first disappointment was to learn that the good doctor was
dead, and when I was shown into the office of his successor
(everything bore such a businesslike air) I found an elderly man
with a long "three-decker" neck and a glacial smile, who, pushing
his spectacles up on to his forehead, said in a freezing voice:</p>
<p>"Well, ma'am, what is <i>your</i> pleasure?"</p>
<p>After a moment of giddiness I began to tell him my
story&mdash;how I had a child and her nurse was not taking proper
care of her; how I was in uncongenial employment myself, but hoped
soon to get better; how I loved my little one and expected to be
able to provide for her presently; and how, therefore, if he would
receive her for a while, only a little while, on the understanding,
the clear and definite understanding, that I could take her away as
soon as I wished to. . . .</p>
<p>Oh dear! Oh dear:</p>
<p>I do not know what there was in my appearance or speech which
betrayed me, but I had got no further than this when the old
gentleman said sharply:</p>
<p>"Can you provide a copy of the register of your child's birth to
show that it is legitimate?"</p>
<p>What answer I made I cannot recollect, except that I told the
truth in a voice with a tremor in it, for a memory of the registry
office was rolling back on me and I could feel my blushes flushing
into my face.</p>
<p>The result was instantaneous. The old gentleman touched a bell,
drew his spectacles down on to his nose, and said in his icy
tones:</p>
<p>"Don't take illegitimate children if we can help it."</p>
<p>It was several days before I recovered from the deep humiliation
of this experience. Then (the exactions of the Olivers quickening
my memory and at the same time deadening my pride) I remembered
something which I had heard the old actress say during my time at
the boarding-house about a hospital in Bloomsbury for unfortunate
children&mdash;how the good man who founded it had been so firm in
his determination that no poor mother in her sorrow should be put
to further shame about her innocent child that he had hung out a
basket at the gate at night in which she could lay her little one,
if she liked, and then ring a bell and hide herself away.</p>
<p>It wasn't easy to reconcile oneself to such philanthropy, but
after a sleepless night, and with rather a sickening pang of
mingled hope and fear, I set off for this hospital.</p>
<p>It was a fine Sunday morning. The working-men in the East End
were sitting at their doors smoking their pipes and reading their
Sunday papers; but when I reached the West all the church bells
were ringing, and people wearing black clothes and shiny black
gloves were walking with measured steps through the wide courtyard
that led to the chapel.</p>
<p>I will not say that I did not feel some qualms at entering a
Protestant church, yet as soon as I had taken my seat and looked up
at the gallery of the organ, where the children sat tier on tier,
so quaint and sweet&mdash;the boys like robins in their bright red
waistcoats, and the girls like rabbits in their mob-caps with
fluted frills&mdash;and the service began, and the fresh young
voices rose in hymns of praise to the good Father of us all, I
thought Of nothing except the joy of seeing Isabel there some day
and hearing her singing in the choir.</p>
<p>When the service was over I asked for the secretary and was
shown into his room.</p>
<p>I dare say he was a good man, but oh! why will so many good
people wear such wintry weather in their faces that merely to look
at them pierces a poor woman to the soul?</p>
<p>Apologising for the day, I told my story again (my head a little
down), saying I understood that it was no barrier to a child in
that orphanage that she had been born outside the pale of the
law.</p>
<p>"On the contrary," said the secretary, "that is precisely the
kind of child this house is intended for."</p>
<p>But when I went on to say that I assumed they still observed the
wish of the founder that no questions of any kind should be asked
about a child's birth or parentage, he said no, they had altered
all that. Then he proceeded to explain that before a child could be
received the mother must now go before a committee of gentlemen to
satisfy them of her previous good character, and that the father of
her baby had deserted both of them.</p>
<p>More than that, he told me that on being received the child was
immediately re-registered and given a new name, in order that it
might be cut off from the sin of its parents and the contamination
of their shame.</p>
<p>It would be impossible for me to describe the feelings with
which I listened to the secretary while he said all this, with the
cast-metal face of a man who was utterly unconscious of the
enormity of the crime he was describing.</p>
<p>"Before a committee of gentlemen?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That is so."</p>
<p>"Who are to ask her all those questions?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And then they are to change her baby's name?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Is she told what the new name is to be?"</p>
<p>"No, but she is given a piece of parchment containing a number
which corresponds with the name in our books."</p>
<p>I rose to my feet, flushing up to the eyes I think, trembling
from head to foot I know, and, forgetting who and what I was and
why I was there&mdash;a poor, helpless, penniless being seeking
shelter for her child&mdash;I burst out on the man in all the mad
wrath of outraged motherhood.</p>
<p>"And you call this a Christian institution!" I said. "You take a
poor woman in her hour of trouble and torture her with an
inquisition into the most secret facts of her life, in public, and
before a committee of men. And then you take her child, and so far
as she is concerned you bury it, and give her a ticket to its
grave. A hospital? This is no hospital. It is a cemetery. And yet
you dare to write over your gates the words of our Lord&mdash;our
holy and loving and blessed Lord&mdash;who said, 'Suffer little
children. . . .'"</p>
<p>But what is the use of repeating what I said then (perhaps
unjustly) or afterwards in the silence of my own room and the
helpless intoxication of my rage?</p>
<p>It was soon stamped out of me.</p>
<p>By the end of another week I was driven to such despair by the
continued extortions of the Olivers that, seeing an advertisement
in the Underground Railway of a Home for children in the country
(asking for subscriptions and showing a group of happy little
people playing under a chestnut-tree in bloom), I decided to make
one more effort.</p>
<p>"They can't all be machines," I thought, "with the founders'
hearts crushed out of them."</p>
<p>The day was Friday, when work was apt to heap up at the Jew's,
and Mrs. Abramovitch had brought vests enough to my room to cover
my bed, but nevertheless I put on my hat and coat and set out for
the orphanage.</p>
<p>It was fifteen miles on the north side of London, so it cost me
something to get there. But I was encouraged by the homelike
appearance of the place when I reached it, and still more by
finding that it was conducted by women, for at last, I thought, the
woman-soul would speak to me.</p>
<p>But hardly had I told my story to the matron, repeating my
request (very timidly this time and with such a humble, humble
heart) that I might be allowed to recover my child as soon as I
found myself able to provide for her, than she stopped me and
said:</p>
<p>"My dear young person, we could have half the orphan children in
London on your terms. Before we accept such a child as yours we
expect the parent to give us a legal undertaking that she
relinquishes all rights in it until it is sixteen years of
age."</p>
<p>"Sixteen? Isn't that rather severe on a mother?" I said.</p>
<p>"Justly severe," said the matron. "Such women should be made to
maintain their children, and thus realise that the way of
transgressors is hard."</p>
<p>How I got back to London, whether by rail or tram or on foot, or
what happened on the way (except that darkness was settling down on
me, within and without), I do not know. I only know that very late
that night, as late as eleven o'clock, I was turning out of Park
Lane into Piccadilly, where the poor "public women" with their
painted faces, dangling their little hand-bags from their wrists,
were promenading in front of the gentlemen's clubs and smiling up
at the windows.</p>
<p>These were the scenes which had formerly appalled me; but now I
was suddenly surprised by a different feeling, and found myself
thinking that among the women who sinned against their womanhood
there might be some who sold themselves for bread to keep those
they loved and who loved them.</p>
<p>This thought was passing through my mind when I heard a hollow
ringing laugh from a woman who was standing at the foot of a flight
of steps talking to a group of three gentlemen whose white shirt
fronts beneath their overcoats showed that they were in evening
dress.</p>
<p>Her laughter was not natural. It had no joy in it, yet she
laughed and laughed, and feeling as if I <i>knew</i> (because life
had that day trampled on me also), I said to myself:</p>
<p>"That woman's heart is dead."</p>
<p>This caused me to glance at her as I passed, when, catching a
side glimpse of her face, I was startled by a memory I could not
fix.</p>
<p>"Where and when have I seen that woman's face before?" I
thought.</p>
<p>It seemed impossible that I could have seen it anywhere. But the
woman's resemblance to somebody I had known, coupled with her
joyless laughter, compelled me to stop at the next corner and look
back.</p>
<p>By this time the gentlemen, who had been treating her lightly (O
God, how men treat such women!), had left her and, coming
arm-in-arm in my direction, with their silk hats tilted a little
back, were saying:</p>
<p>"Poor old Aggie! She's off!" "Completely off!" "Is it drink, I
wonder?"</p>
<p>And then, seeing me, they said:</p>
<p>"Gad, here's a nice little gal, though!" "No rouge, neither!"
"By Jove, no! Her face is as white as a waterlily!"</p>
<p>Seeing that they were wheeling round, and fearing they were
going to speak to me, I moved back and so came face to face with
the woman, who was standing where they had left her, silent now,
and looking after the men with fierce eyes under the fair hair that
curled over her forehead.</p>
<p>Then in a moment a memory from the far past swept over me, and I
cried, almost as if the name had been forced out of me:</p>
<p>"Sister Angela!"</p>
<p>The woman started, and it seemed for a moment as if she were
going to run away. Then she laid hold of me by the arm and, looking
searchingly into my face, said:</p>
<p>"Who are you? . . . I know. You are Mary O'Neill, aren't
you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I knew you were. I read about your marriage to that . . . that
man. And now you are wondering why I am here. Well, come home with
me and see."</p>
<p>It was not until afterwards that I knew by what mistake about my
presence in that place Angela thought she must justify herself in
my eyes (mine!); but taking me by the hand, just as she used to do
when I was a child, she led, almost pulled, me down Piccadilly, and
my will was so broken that I did not attempt to resist her.</p>
<p>We crossed Piccadilly Circus, with its white sheet of electric
light, and, turning into the darker thoroughfares on the northern
side of it, walked on until, in a narrow street of the Italian
quarter of Soho, we stopped at a private door by the side of a
caf&eacute; that had an Italian name on the window.</p>
<p>"This is where we live. Come in," said Angela, and I followed
her through a long empty lobby and up three flights of bare
stairs.</p>
<p>While we ascended, there was the deadened sound, as from the
caf&eacute;, of men singing (in throbbing voices to mandolines and
guitars) one of the Italian songs which I remembered to have heard
from the piazza outside the convent on that night when Sister
Angela left me in bed while she went off to visit the chaplain:</p>
<p>"<i>Oh bella Napoli, Oh suol beato<br />
Onde sorridere volle il creato.</i>"</p>
<p>"The Italian Club," said Angela. "Only one flight more.
Come!"</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_FIRST_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_FIRST_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND FIRST
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>At length Angela opened, with a key from her satchel, a door on
the top landing, and we entered a darkened room which was partly in
the roof.</p>
<p>As we stepped in I heard rapid breathing, which told me that we
were in a sick chamber, and then a man's voice, very husky and
weak, saying:</p>
<p>"Is that you, Agnes?"</p>
<p>"It's only me, dear," said Angela..</p>
<p>After a moment she turned up the solitary gas-jet, which had
been burning low, and I saw the shadowy form of a man lying in a
bed that stood in a corner. He was wasted with consumption, his
long bony hands were lying on the counterpane, his dark hair was
matted over his forehead as from sweat, but I could not mistake the
large, lively grey eyes that looked out of his long thin face. It
was Father Giovanni.</p>
<p>Angela went up to him and kissed him, and I could see that his
eyes lighted with a smile as he saw her coming into the room.</p>
<p>"There's somebody with you, isn't there?" he said.</p>
<p>"Yes. Who do you think it is?"</p>
<p>"Who?"</p>
<p>"Don't you remember little Margaret Mary at the Sacred
Heart?"</p>
<p>"Is this she?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said Angela, and then in a hoarse, angry voice the man
said:</p>
<p>"What has she come here for?"</p>
<p>Angela told him that I had seen her on Piccadilly, and being a
great lady now, I (Oh heaven!) was one of the people who came out
into the streets at midnight to rescue lost ones.</p>
<p>"She looked as if she wondered what had brought me down to that
life, so I've fetched her home to see."</p>
<p>I was shocked at Angela's mistake, but before I could gather
strength or courage to correct her Giovanni was raising himself in
bed and saying, with a defiant air, his eyes blazing like
watch-fires:</p>
<p>"She does it for me, if you want to know. I've been eleven
months ill&mdash;she does it all for me, I tell you."</p>
<p>And then, in one of those outbursts of animation which come to
the victims of that fell disease, he gave me a rapid account of
what had happened to them since they ran away from Rome&mdash;how
at first he had earned their living as a teacher of languages; how
it became known that he was an unfrocked and excommunicated priest
who had broken his vows, and then his pupils had left him; how they
had struggled on for some years longer, though pursued by this
character as by a malignant curse; and how at length his health had
quite broken down, and he would have starved but for Agnes (Angela
being her nun's name), who had stuck to him through everything.</p>
<p>While the sick man said this in his husky voice, Angela was
sitting on the bed by his side with her arm about his waist,
listening to him with a sort of pride and looking at me with a kind
of triumph.</p>
<p>"I dare say you wonder why I didn't try to get work," she said.
"I <i>could</i> have got it if I had wanted to. I could have got it
at the Italian laundry. But what was two shillings a day to a man
who was ordered new milk and fresh eggs five times every
twenty-four hours, not to speak of the house rent?"</p>
<p>"She ought to have let me die first," said Giovanni, and then,
looking at me again with his large, glittering, fierce eyes, he
said:</p>
<p>"<i>You</i> think she ought to have let me die, don't you?"</p>
<p>"No, no, no," I said&mdash;it was all I <i>could</i> say, for
their mistake about myself was choking me.</p>
<p>Perhaps my emotion appeased both of them, for after a moment
Angela beat out Giovanni's pillow and straightened his counterpane,
and then told him to lie down and be quiet, while she brought a
chair for me and took off her things in her own bedroom.</p>
<p>But hardly had she gone into an adjoining chamber when the sick
man raised himself again and, reaching over in my direction, told
me in a hoarse whisper the story of the first night of her present
way of life&mdash;how the doctor had said he must be removed to the
hospital; how Agnes would not part with him; how the landlord had
threatened to turn them out; and how at last, after sitting with
her head in her hands the whole evening, Aggie had got up and gone
out and, coming back at midnight, had thrown two sovereigns on the
table and said, "There you are, Giovanni&mdash;that's our rent and
your eggs and milk for one week, anyway."</p>
<p>By this time Angela had returned to the room (her paint and
rouge washed off, and her gay clothes replaced by a simple woollen
jacket over a plain underskirt), and she began to beat up an egg,
to boil some milk, to pour out a dose of medicine, and to do, with
all a good woman's tact, a good woman's tenderness, the little
services of which an invalid stands in need.</p>
<p>Oh heavens, how beautiful it was&mdash;fearfully, awfully
tragically beautiful!</p>
<p>I was deeply moved as I sat in silence watching her; and when at
length Giovanni, who had been holding her hand in his own long,
bony ones and sometimes putting it to his lips, dropped off to
sleep (tired out, perhaps, by talking to me), and she, drawing up
to where I sat by the end of the bed, resumed her self-defence,
saying in a whisper that ladies like me could not possibly
understand what a woman would do, in spite of herself, when the
life of one she loved was threatened, I could bear her mistake no
longer, but told her of my real condition&mdash;that I was no
longer a lady, that I had run away from my husband, that I had a
child, and was living as a poor seamstress in the East End of
London.</p>
<p>Angela listened to my story in astonishment; and when I had come
to an end she was holding my hand and looking into my eyes with
just that look which she had when she put me to bed for the first
time at school, and, making her voice very low, told me to be a
good child of the Infant Jesus.</p>
<p>"It's nearly one o'clock. You can't go back to the East End
to-night," she whispered.</p>
<p>"Oh, I must, I must," I said, getting up and making for the
door. But before I had reached it my limbs gave way, whether from
the strain of emotion or physical weakness, and if it had not been
for Angela I should have dropped to the floor.</p>
<p>After that she would hear of no excuses. I must stay until
morning. I could sleep in her own bed in the other room, and she
could lay a mattress for herself on the floor by the side of
Giovanni's. There would be no great sacrifice in that. It was going
to be one of Giovanni's bad nights, and she was likely to be up and
down all the time anyway.</p>
<p>Half an hour later I was in bed in a little room that was
separated by a thin papered partition from the room of the poor
consumptive, and Angela, who had brought me a cup of hot milk, was
saying in a whisper:</p>
<p>"He's very bad. The doctor says he can't last longer than a
week. Sister Veronica (you remember her, she's Mildred Bankes that
used to be) tried to get him into a home for the dying. It was all
arranged, too, but at the last moment he wouldn't go. He told them
that, if they wanted to separate him from Agnes, they had better
bring his coffin because he would be dead before they got him to
the door."</p>
<p>When she had gone I lay a long time in the dark, listening to
the sounds on the other side of the partition.</p>
<p>Giovanni awoke with an alarming fit of coughing, and in the
querulous, plaintive, fretful, sometimes angry tones which invalids
have, he grumbled at Angela and then cried over her, saying what a
burden he was to her, while she, moving about the room in her bare
feet, coaxed and caressed him, and persuaded him to take his milk
or his medicine.</p>
<p>Through all this I would hear at intervals the drumming noises
of the singing downstairs, which sounded in my ears (as the singers
were becoming more and more intoxicated) like the swirling and
screeching of an ironical requiem for the dying man before he was
dead:</p>
<p>"<i>Oh bella Napoli, Oh suol beato<br />
Onde sorridere volle il creato</i>."</p>
<p>But somewhere in those dead hours in which London sleeps
everything became still, and my mind, which had been questioning
the grim darkness on the worst of the world's tragedies (what a
woman will do for those she loves), fell back on myself and I
thought of the Christian institutions which had turned me from
their doors, and then of this "street-walker" who had given up her
own bed to me and was now lying in the next room on a mattress on
the floor.</p>
<p>I could not help it if I felt a startling reverence for Angela,
as a ministering angel faithful unto death, and I remembered that
as I fell asleep I was telling myself that we all needed God's
mercy, God's pardon, and that, God would forgive her because she
had loved much.</p>
<p>But sleep was more tolerant still I dreamt that Angela died, and
on reaching the gates of heaven all the saints of God met her, and
after they had clothed her in a spotless white robe, one of
them&mdash;it was the blessed Mary Magdalene&mdash;took her hand
and said:</p>
<p>"Here is another of the holy martyrs."</p>
<p>I awoke from that dream with beads of perspiration on my
forehead. But I dare not say what confused and terrible thoughts
came next, except that they were about baby&mdash;what I might do
myself if driven to the last extremity. When I slept and dreamt
again, it was I who was dead, and it was my darling mother who met
me and took me to the feet of the Blessed Virgin and said:</p>
<p>"Mother of all Mothers, who knows all that is in a mother's
heart, this is my little daughter. She did not intend to do wrong.
It was all for the sake of her child."</p>
<p>When I awoke in the morning, with the darkness shivering off
through the gloom, this last dream was sitting upon me like a
nightmare. It terrified me. I felt as if I were standing on the
edge of a precipice and some awful forces were trying to push me
over it.</p>
<p>The London sparrows were chirping on the skylight over my head,
and I could faintly hear the Italian criers in the front
street:</p>
<p>"Latte!" "Spazzina!" "Erbaggi freschi!"</p>
<p>In spite of myself (hating myself for it after all the
tenderness that had been shown me), I could not overcome a feeling
of shame at finding myself lying where I was, and I got up to run
away that I might cleanse my soul of the evil thoughts which had
come to me while there.</p>
<p>As I dressed I listened for a sound from the adjoining room. All
was quiet now. The poor restless ones were at last getting a little
rest.</p>
<p>A few minutes afterwards I passed on tiptoe through their room
without looking towards the bed, and reaching the door to the
staircase I opened it as noiselessly as I could.</p>
<p>Then I closed it softly after me, on so much suffering and so
much love.</p>

<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_SECOND_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_SECOND_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND SECOND
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>The sun was shining in the street. It was one of those clear,
clean, frosty mornings when the very air of London, even in the
worst places, seems to be washed by the sunlight from the sin and
drink of the night before.</p>
<p>I was on my way to that church among the mews of Mayfair to
which I had gone so frequently during the early days of my marriage
when I was struggling against the mortal sin (as I thought it was)
of loving Martin.</p>
<p>Just as I reached the church and was ascending the steps, a
gorgeous landau with high-stepping horses and a powdered footman
drew up at the bottom of them.</p>
<p>The carriage, which bore a coronet on the door, contained a lady
in long furs, a rosy-faced baby-girl in squirrel skins with a large
doll in her arms, and a nurse.</p>
<p>I could see that, like myself, the lady (a young mother) had
come to confess, for as she rose from her seat she told the child
to sit quiet and be good and she would not keep her long.</p>
<p>"Tum out soon, mummy, and dolly will lub you eber and eber,"
said the child.</p>
<p>The lady stooped and kissed the little one, and then, with a
proud and happy look, stepped out of the carriage and passed into
the church, while the door-keeper opened the vestibule door for her
and bowed deeply.</p>
<p>I stood at the top of the steps for a moment looking back at the
carriage, the horses, the footman, the nurse, and, above all, the
baby-girl with her doll, and then followed the lady into the
church.</p>
<p>Apparently mass was just over. Little spirelets of smoke were
rising from the candles on the altar which the sacristan was
putting out, a few communicants were still on their knees, and
others with light yet echoing footsteps were making for the
door.</p>
<p>The lady in furs had already taken her place at one of the
confessional boxes, and as there seemed to be no other that was
occupied by a priest, I knelt on a chair in the nave and tried to
fix my mind on the prayers (once so familiar) for the examination
of conscience before confession:</p>
<p>"<i>Oh, Lord Jesus Christ, dispel the darkness of my heart, that
I may bewail my sins and rightly confess them</i>."</p>
<p>But the labouring of my spirit was like the flight of a bat in
the daylight. Though I tried hard to keep my mind from wandering, I
could not do so. Again and again it went back to the lady in furs
with the coroneted carriage and the high-stepping horses.</p>
<p>She was about my own age, and she began to rise before my
tightly closed eyes as a vision of what I might have been myself if
I had not given up everything for love&mdash;wealth, rank, title,
luxury.</p>
<p>God is my witness that down to that moment I had never once
thought I had made any sacrifice, but now, as by a flash of cruel
lightning, I saw myself as I was&mdash;a peeress who had run away
from her natural condition and was living in the slums, working
like any other work-girl.</p>
<p>Even this did not hurt me much, but when I thought of the
rosy-faced child in the carriage, and then of my own darling at
Mrs. Oliver's as I had seen her last, so thin and pale, and with
her little bib stained by her curdled milk, a feeling I had never
had before pierced to my very soul.</p>
<p>I asked myself if this was what God looked down upon and
permitted&mdash;that because I had obeyed what I still believed to
be the purest impulse of my nature, love, my child must be made to
suffer.</p>
<p>Then something hard began to form in my heart. I told myself
that what I had been taught to believe about God was falsehood and
deception.</p>
<p>All this time I was trying to hush down my mind by saying my
prayer, which called on the gracious Virgin Mary to intercede for
me with my Redeemer, and the holy Saints of God to assist me.</p>
<p>"<i>Assist me by thy grace, that I may be able to declare my
sins to the priest, thy Vicar</i>."</p>
<p>It was of no use. Every moment my heart was hardening, and what
I had intended to confess about my wicked thoughts of the night
before was vanishing away. At last I rose to my feet and, lifting
my head, looked boldly up at the altar.</p>
<p>Just at that moment the young peeress, having finished her
confession, went off with a light step and a cheerful face. Her
kneeling-place at the confessional box was now vacant, yet I did
not attempt to take it, and some minutes passed in which I stood
biting my lips to prevent a cry. Then the priest parted his
curtains and beckoned to me, and I moved across and stood
stubbornly by the perforated brass grating.</p>
<p>"Father," I said, as firmly as I could, for my throat was
fluttering, "I came here to make my confession, but something has
come over me since I entered this church, and now I cannot."</p>
<p>"What has come over you, my child?" asked the priest.</p>
<p>"I feel that what is said about God in a place like this, that
He is a kind and beneficent Father, who is just and merciful and
pities the sufferings of His children, is untrue. It is all wrong
and false. <i>God does not care</i>."</p>
<p>The priest did not answer me immediately, but after a moment of
silence he said in a quivering voice:</p>
<p>"My child, I feel just like that myself sometimes. It is the
devil tempting you. He is standing by your side and whispering in
your ear, at this moment."</p>
<p>I shuddered, and the priest added:</p>
<p>"I see how it is, my daughter. You are suffering, and those you
love are suffering too. But must you surrender your faith on that
account? Look round at the pictures on these walls [the Stations of
the Cross]. Think of the Great Sufferer, the Great Martyr, who in
the hour of His death, at the malicious power of the world, cried,
'<i>Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani</i>: My God, My God, why hast Thou
forsaken Me?'"</p>
<p>I had dropped to my knees by now, my head was down, and my hands
were clasped together.</p>
<p>"You are wrong, my child, if you think God does not care for you
because He allows you to suffer. Are you rich? Are you prosperous?
Have you every earthly blessing? Then beware, for Satan is watching
for your soul. But are you poor? Are you going through unmerited
trouble? Have you lost some one who was dearer to you than your
heart of hearts? Then take courage, for our holy and blessed
Saviour has marked you for His own."</p>
<p>I know nothing of that priest except his whispering voice,
which, coming through the grating of the confessional, produced the
effect of the supernatural, but I thought then, and I think now,
that he must have been a great as well as a good man.</p>
<p>I perfectly recollect that, when I left the church and passed
into the streets, it seemed as if his spirit went with me and built
up in my soul a resolution that was bright with heavenly tears and
sunshine.</p>
<p>Work! Work! Work! I should work still harder than before. No
matter how mean, ill-paid, and uncongenial my work might be, I
should work all day and all night if necessary. And since I had
failed to get my child into an orphanage, it was clearly intended
that I should keep her with me, for my own charge and care and
joy.</p>
<p>This was the mood in which I returned to the house of the
Jew.</p>
<p>It was Saturday morning, and though the broader thoroughfares of
the East End were crowded and the narrower streets full of life,
the Jew's house was silent, for it was the Jewish Sabbath.</p>
<p>As I went hurriedly upstairs I heard the Jew himself, who was
dressing for the synagogue, singing his Sabbath hymn: <i>Lerho
daudee likras kollo</i>&mdash;"Come, O friend, let us go forth to
meet the Bride, let us receive the Sabbath with joy!"</p>
<p>Then came a shock.</p>
<p>When I reached my room I found, to my dismay, that the pile of
vests which I had left on my bed on going out the day before had
been removed; and just as I was telling myself that no one else
except Mrs. Abramovitch had a key to my door I heard shuffling
footsteps on the stair, and knew that her husband was coming up to
me.</p>
<p>A moment afterwards the Jew stood in my doorway. He was dressed
in his Sabbath suit and, free from the incongruous indications of
his homely calling, the patriarchal appearance which had first
struck me was even more marked than before. His face was pale, his
expression was severe, and if his tongue betrayed the broken
English of the Polish Jew, I, in my confusion and fear, did not
notice it then.</p>
<p>My first thought was that he had come to reprove me for
neglecting my work, and I was prepared to promise to make up for my
absence. But at a second glance I saw that something had happened,
something had become known, and that he was there to condemn and
denounce me.</p>
<p>"You have been out all night," he said. "Can you tell me where
you have been?"</p>
<p>I knew I could not, and though it flashed upon me to say that I
had slept at the house of a friend, I saw that, if he asked who my
friend was, and what, I should be speechless.</p>
<p>The Jew waited for my reply and then said:</p>
<p>"You have given us a name&mdash;can you say it is your true and
right one?"</p>
<p>Again I made no answer, and after another moment the Jew
said:</p>
<p>"Can you deny that you have a child whom you have hidden from
our knowledge?"</p>
<p>I felt myself gasping, but still I did not speak.</p>
<p>"Can you say that it was lawfully born according to your
Christian marriage?"</p>
<p>I felt the colour flushing into my face but I was still silent;
and after a moment in which, as I could see, the stern-natured Jew
was summing me up as a woman of double life and evil character, he
said:</p>
<p>"Then it is true? . . . Very well, you will understand that from
this day you cease to be in my service."</p>
<p>All this time my eyes were down, but I was aware that somebody
else had come into the room. It was Miriam, and she was trying to
plead for me.</p>
<p>"Father . . ." she began, but, turning hotly upon her, the Jew
cried passionately:</p>
<p>"Go away! A true daughter of Israel should know better than to
speak for such a woman."</p>
<p>I heard the girl going slowly down the stairs, and then the Jew,
stepping up to me and speaking more loudly than before, said:</p>
<p>"Woman, leave my house at once, before you corrupt the
conscience of my child."</p>
<p>Again I became aware that some one had come into the room. It
was Mrs. Abramovitch, and she, too, was pleading for me.</p>
<p>"Israel! Calm thyself! Do not give way to injustice and anger.
On Shobbos morning, too!"</p>
<p>"Hannah," said the Jew, "thou speakest with thy mouth, not thy
heart. The Christian doth not deny that she hath given thee a false
name, and is the adulterous mother of a misbegotten child. If she
were a Jewish woman she would be summoned before the Beth Din, and
in better days our law of Moses would have stoned her. Shall she,
because she is a Christian, dishonour a good Jewish house? No! The
hand of the Lord would go out against me."</p>
<p>"But she is homeless, and she hath been a good servant to thee,
Israel. Give her time to find another shelter."</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence after that, and then the Jew
said:</p>
<p>"Very well! It shall not be said that Israel Abramovitch knows
not to temper justice with mercy."</p>
<p>And then, my face being still down, I heard him saying over my
head:</p>
<p>"You may stay here another week. After that I wash my hands of
thee."</p>
<p>With these hard words he turned away, and I heard him going
heavily down the stairs. His wife stayed a little longer, saying
something in a kind voice, which I did not comprehend, and then she
followed him.</p>
<p>I do not think I had spoken a word. I continued to stand where
the Jew had left me. After a while I heard him closing and locking
the door of his own apartment, and knew that he was going off to
his synagogue in Brick Lane in his tall silk hat worn on the back
of his head like a skull-cap, and with his wife and daughter behind
him, carrying his leather-bound prayer-book.</p>
<p>I hardly knew what else was happening. My heart was heaving like
a dead body on a billow. All that the priest had said was gone. In
its place there was a paralysing despair as if the wheels of life
were rolling over me.</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM BY MARTIN CONRAD</p>
<p>My dear, long-suffering, martyred darling!</p>
<p>It makes my blood boil to see how the very powers of darkness,
in the name of religion, morality, philanthropy and the judgment of
God, were persecuting my poor little woman.</p>
<p>But why speak of myself at all, or interrupt my darling's
narrative, except to say what was happening in my efforts to reach
her?</p>
<p>While we were swinging along in our big liner over the heaving
bosom of the Mediterranean the indefinable sense of her danger
never left me day or night.</p>
<p>That old dream of the glacier and the precipice continued to
haunt my sleep, with the difference that, instead of the aurora
glistening in my dear one's eyes, there was now a blizzard behind
her.</p>
<p>The miserable thing so tortured me as we approached Malta (where
I expected to receive a reply to the cable I had sent from Port
Said to the house of Daniel O'Neill) that I felt physically weak at
the thought of the joy or sorrow ahead of me.</p>
<p>Though there was no telegram from my darling at Malta, there was
one from the chairman of my committee, saying he was coming to
Marseilles to meet our steamer and would sail the rest of the way
home with us.</p>
<p>Indirectly this brought me a certain comfort. It reminded me of
the letter I had written for my dear one on the day I left Castle
Raa. Sixteen months had passed since then, serious things had
happened in the interval, and I had never thought of that letter
before.</p>
<p>It was not to her father, as she supposed, and certainly not to
her husband. It was to my chairman, asking him, in the event of my
darling sending it on, to do whatever was necessary to protect her
during my absence.</p>
<p>If my chairman had not received that letter, my conclusion would
be that my dear little woman had never been reduced to such straits
as to require help from any one. If he had in fact received it, he
must have done what I wished, and therefore everything would be
well.</p>
<p>There was a certain suspense as well as a certain consolation in
all this, and before our big ship slowed down at Marseilles I was
on deck searching for my chairman among the people waiting for us
on the pier.</p>
<p>I saw him immediately, waving his travelling cap with a flourish
of joy, and I snatched a little comfort from that.</p>
<p>As soon as the steamer was brought to, he was the first to come
aboard, and I scanned his face as he hurried up the gangway. It was
beaming.</p>
<p>"It's all right," I thought; "a man could not look as happy as
that if he were bringing me bad news."</p>
<p>A moment afterwards he was shaking my hand, clapping me on the
shoulder, and saying:</p>
<p>"Splendid! Magnificent! Glorious achievement! Proved your point
up to the hilt, my boy!"</p>
<p>And when I said something about not having gone all the way he
cried:</p>
<p>"Never mind! You'll do it next time," which made some of my
shipmates who were standing round with shining eyes say, "Aye, aye,
sir," and then one of them (it was good old O'Sullivan)
shouted:</p>
<p>"By the stars of heaven, that's thrue, my lord! And if anybody's
after saying that the Commanther was turned back this time by
anything less than the almighty power of Nature in her wrath, you
may say there's forty-eight of us here to tell him he lies."</p>
<p>"I believe it," said the chairman, and then there were further
congratulations, with messages from members of my committee, but
never a word from my dear one.</p>
<p>Thinking the chairman might hesitate to speak of a private
matter until we were alone, I took him down to my state-room. But
he had nothing to say there, either, except about articles to be
written, reports to be compiled, and invitations to be
accepted.</p>
<p>Several hours passed like this. We were again out at sea, and my
longing to know what had happened was consuming me, but I dared not
ask from fear of a bad answer.</p>
<p>Before the night was out, however, I had gone to work in a
roundabout way. Taking O'Sullivan into my confidence, I told him it
had not been my parents that I had been anxious about (God forgive
me!), but somebody else whom he had seen and spoken to.</p>
<p>"Do you mean Mal . . . I should say Lady . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"By the holy saints, the way I was thinking that when I brought
you the letter at Port Said, and saw the clouds of heaven still
hanging on you."</p>
<p>I found that the good fellow had a similar trouble of his own
(not yet having heard from his mother), so he fell readily into my
plan, which was that of cross-questioning the chairman about my
dear one, and I about his, and then meeting secretly and imparting
what we had learned.</p>
<p>Anybody may laugh who likes at the thought of two big lumbering
fellows afraid to face the truth (scouting round and round it), but
it grips me by the throat to this day to see myself taking our
chairman into a quiet corner of the smoke-room and saying:</p>
<p>"Poor old O'Sullivan! He hasn't heard from his old mother yet.
She was sick when he sailed, and wouldn't have parted with him to
go with anybody except myself. You haven't heard of her, have
you?"</p>
<p>And then to think of O'Sullivan doing the same for me, with:</p>
<p>"The poor Commanther! Look at him there. Faith, he's keeping a
good heart, isn't he? But it's just destroyed he is for want of
news of a great friend that was in trouble. It was a girl . . . a
lady, I mane. You haven't heard the whisper of a word, sir . . .
eh?"</p>
<p>Our chairman had heard nothing. And when (bracing myself at
last) I asked point-blank if anything had been sent to him as from
me, and he answered "No," I might have been relieved, but I wasn't.
Though I did not know then that my darling had burnt my letter, I
began to feel that she was the last person in the world to use it,
being (God bless her!) of the mettle that makes a woman want to
fight her own battles without asking help of any one.</p>
<p>This quite crushed down my heart, for, seeing that she had sent
no reply to my cables, I could not find any escape from the
conclusion that she was where no word could come from her&mdash;she
was dead!</p>
<p>Lord God, how I suffered when this phantom got into my mind! I
used to walk up and down the promenade deck late into the night,
trying and condemning myself as if I had been my own judge and
jury.</p>
<p>"She is dead. I have killed her," I thought.</p>
<p>Thank God, the phantom was soon laid by the gladdest sight I
ever saw on earth or ever expect to see, and it wouldn't be
necessary to speak of it now but for the glorious confidence it
brought me.</p>
<p>It was the same with me as with a ship-broken man whom
Providence comes to relieve in his last extremity, and I could fix
the place of mine as certainly as if I had marked it on a chart. We
had called at Gibraltar (where O'Sullivan had received a letter
from his mother, saying she was splendid) and were running along
the coast of Portugal.</p>
<p>It was a dirty black night, with intervals of rain, I remember.
While my shipmates were making cheerful times of it in the
smoke-room (O'Sullivan with heart at ease singing the "Minsthrel
Boy" to a chorus of noisy cheers) I was walking up and down the
deck with my little stock of courage nearly gone, for turn which
way I would it was dark, dark, dark, when just as we picked up the
lights of Finisterre something said to me, as plainly as words
could speak:</p>
<p>"What in the name of thunder are you thinking about? Do you mean
to say that you were turned back in the 88th latitude, and have
been hurried home without the loss of a moment, only to find
everything over at the end of your journey? No, no, no! Your poor,
dear, heroic little woman is alive! She may be in danger, and beset
by all the powers of the devil, but that's just why you have been
brought home to save her, and you <i>will</i> save her, as surely
as the sun will rise to-morrow morning."</p>
<p>There are thoughts which, like great notes in music, grip you by
the soul and lift you into a world which you don't naturally belong
to. This was one of them.</p>
<p>Never after that did I feel one moment's real anxiety. I was my
own man once more; and though I continued to walk the deck while
our good ship sped along in the night, it was only because there
was a kind of wild harmony between the mighty voice of the rolling
billows of the Bay and the unheard anthem of boundless hope that
was singing in my breast.</p>
<p>I recollect that during my walk a hymn was always haunting me.
It was the same that we used to sing in the shuddering darkness of
that perpetual night, when we stood (fifty downhearted men) under
the shelter of our snow camp, with a ninety mile blizzard shrieking
above us:</p>
<p>"<i>Lead, kindly Light, amid th' encircling gloom,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 5em;">Lead Thou me
on."</span><br /></i></p>
<p>But the light was within me now, and I knew as certainly as that
the good ship was under my feet that I was being carried home at
the call of the Spirit to rescue my stricken darling.</p>
<p>God keep her on her solitary way! England! England! England!
Less than a week and I should be there!</p>
<p>That was early hours on Saturday morning&mdash;the very Saturday
when my poor little woman, after she had been turned away by those
prating philanthropists, was being sheltered by the prostitute.</p>
<p>Let him explain it who can. I cannot.</p>

<p>[END OF MARTIN CONRAD'S MEMORANDUM]</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_THIRD_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_THIRD_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND THIRD
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I must have been sitting a full hour or more on the end of my
bed&mdash;stunned, stupefied, unable to think&mdash;when Miriam,
back from the synagogue, came stealthily upstairs to say that a
messenger had come for me about six o'clock the night before.</p>
<p>"He said his name was Oliver, and father saw him, and that's how
he came to know. 'Tell her that her child is ill, and she is to
come immediately,' he said."</p>
<p>I was hardly conscious of what happened next&mdash;hardly aware
of passing through the streets to Ilford. I had a sense of houses
flying by as they seem to do from an express train; of my knees
trembling; of my throat tightening; and of my whole soul crying out
to God to save the life of my child until I could get to her.</p>
<p>When I reached the house of the Olivers the worst of my fears
were relieved. Mrs. Oliver was sitting before the fire with baby on
her lap.</p>
<p>At sight of me the woman began to mumble out something about my
delay, and how she could not be held responsible if anything
happened; but caring nothing about responsibility, hers or mine, I
took baby from her without more words.</p>
<p>My child was in a state of deep drowsiness, and when I tried to
rouse her I could not do so. I gathered that this condition had
lasted twenty-four hours, during which she had taken no
nourishment, with the result that she was now very thin.</p>
<p>I knew nothing of children's ailments but a motherly instinct
must have come to my aid, for I called for a bath, and bathed baby,
and she awoke, and then took a little food.</p>
<p>But again she dropped back into the drowsy condition, and Mrs.
Oliver, who was alarmed, called in some of the neighbours to look
at her.</p>
<p>Apparently the mission of the good women was to comfort Mrs.
Oliver, not me, but they said, "Sleep never did no harm to nobody,"
and I found a certain consolation in that.</p>
<p>Hours passed. I was barely sensible of anything that happened
beyond the narrow circle of my own lap, but at one moment I heard
the squirling of a brass band that was going up the street, with
the shuffling of an irregular procession.</p>
<p>"It's the strike," said Mrs. Oliver, running to the window.
"There's Ted, carrying a banner."</p>
<p>A little later I heard the confused noises of a strike meeting,
which was being held on the Green. It was like the croaking of a
frog-pond, with now and then a strident voice (the bricklayer's)
crying "Buckle your belts tighter, and starve rather than give in,
boys." Still later I heard the procession going away, singing with
a slashing sound that was like driving wind and pelting rain:</p>
<p>"<i>The land, the land, the blessed, blessed land,<br />
Gawd gave the land to the people</i>."</p>
<p>But nothing awakened baby, and towards three in the afternoon
(the idea that she was really ill having taken complete possession
of me) I asked where I could find the nearest doctor, and being
told, I went off in search of him.</p>
<p>The doctor was on his rounds, so I left a written message
indicating baby's symptoms and begging him to come to her
immediately.</p>
<p>On the way back I passed a number of children's
funerals&mdash;easily recognisable by the combined coach and
hearse, the white linen "weepers" worn by the coachman and his
assistant, and the little coffin, sprinkled with cheap flowers, in
the glass case behind the driver's seat. These sights, which
brought back a memory of the woman who carried my baby down the
Mile End Road, almost deprived me of my senses.</p>
<p>I had hardly got back and taken off my coat and warmed my hands
and dress by the fire before taking baby in my lap, when the
doctor, in his gig, pulled up at the door.</p>
<p>He was a young man, but he seemed to take in the situation in a
moment. I was the mother, wasn't I? Yes. And this woman was baby's
nurse? Yes.</p>
<p>Then he drew up a chair and looked steadfastly down at baby, and
I went through that breathless moment, which most of us know, when
we are waiting for the doctor's first word.</p>
<p>"Some acute digestive trouble here apparently," he said, and
then something about finding out the cause of it.</p>
<p>But hardly had he put his hands on my child as she lay in my lap
than there came a faintly discoloured vomit.</p>
<p>"What have you been giving her?" he said, looking round at Mrs.
Oliver.</p>
<p>Mrs. Oliver protested that she had given baby nothing except her
milk, but the doctor said sharply:</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense, woman. Show me what you've given her."</p>
<p>Then Mrs. Oliver, looking frightened, went upstairs and brought
down a bottle of medicine, saying it was a soothing syrup which I
had myself bought for baby's cough.</p>
<p>"As I thought!" said the doctor, and going to the door and
opening it, he flung the bottle on to the waste ground opposite,
saying as he did so:</p>
<p>"If I hear of you giving your babies any more of your soothing
syrup I'll see what the Inspector has to say."</p>
<p>After that, ignoring nurse, he asked me some searching and
intimate questions&mdash;if I had had a great grief or shock or
worry while baby was coming, and whether and how long I had nursed
her.</p>
<p>I answered as truthfully as I could, though I saw the drift of
his inquiries, and was trembling with fear of what he would tell me
next.</p>
<p>He said nothing then, however, except to make his
recommendations. And remembering my loss of work, my heart sank as
he enumerated baby's needs&mdash;fresh cow's milk diluted with lime
water, small quantities of meat juice, and twenty to thirty drops
of the best brandy three or four times a day.</p>
<p>When he rose to go I paid his fee. It was only half-a-crown, but
he cannot have known how much that meant to me, for as he was
leaving the kitchen he told me to send for him again in the morning
if there were a change in the symptoms.</p>
<p>Feeling that I did not yet know the whole truth (though I was
trembling in terror of it), I handed baby to Mrs. Oliver and
followed the doctor to the door.</p>
<p>"Doctor," I said, "is my baby very ill?"</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment and then answered, "Yes."</p>
<p>"Dangerously ill?"</p>
<p>Again he hesitated, and then looking closely at me (I felt my
lower lip trembling) he said:</p>
<p>"I won't say that. She's suffering from marasmus, provoked by
overdoses of the pernicious stuff that is given by ignorant and
unscrupulous people to a restless child to keep it quiet. But her
real trouble comes of maternal weakness, and the only cure for that
is good nourishment and above all fresh air and sunshine."</p>
<p>"Will she get better?"</p>
<p>"If you can take her away, into the country she will,
certainly."</p>
<p>"And if . . . if I can't," I asked, the words fluttering up to
my lips, "will she . . . <i>die</i>?"</p>
<p>The doctor looked steadfastly at me again (I was biting my lip
to keep it firm), and said:</p>
<p>"She <i>may</i>."</p>
<p>When I returned to the kitchen I knew that I was face to face
with another of the great mysteries of a woman's
life&mdash;Death&mdash;the death of my child, which my very love
and tenderness had exposed her to.</p>
<p>Meantime Mrs. Oliver, who was as white as a whitewashed wall,
was excusing herself in a whining voice that had the sound of a
spent wave. She wouldn't have hurt the pore dear precious for
worlds, and if it hadn't been for Ted, who was so tired at night
and wanted sleep after walking in percession. . . .</p>
<p>Partly to get rid of the woman I sent her out (with almost the
last of my money) for some of the things ordered by the doctor.
While she was away, and I was looking down at the little silent
face on my lap, praying for one more glimpse of my Martin's
sea-blue eyes, the bricklayer came lunging into the house.</p>
<p>"Where's Lizer?" he said.</p>
<p>I told him and he cried:</p>
<p>"The baiby again! Allus the baiby!"</p>
<p>With that he took out of his pocket a cake of moist tobacco, cut
and rolled some of it in his palm, and then charged his pipe and
lit it&mdash;filling the air with clouds of rank smoke, which made
baby bark and cough without rousing her.</p>
<p>I pointed this out to him and asked him not to smoke.</p>
<p>"Eh?" he said, and then I told him that the doctor had been
called and what he had said about fresh air.</p>
<p>"So that's it, is it?" he said. "Good! Just reminds me of
something I want to say, so I'll introdooce the matter now, in a
manner o' speaking. Last night I 'ad to go to Mile End for you, and
here's Lizer out on a sim'lar arrand. If people 'ave got to be
'ospital nurses to a sick baiby they ought to be paid, mind ye.
We're only pore, and it may be a sacred dooty walkin' in
percession, but it ain't fillin'."</p>
<p>Choking with anger, I said:</p>
<p>"Put out your pipe, please."</p>
<p>"Ma'am to <i>you</i>!"</p>
<p>"Put it out this moment, sir, or I'll see if I can't find
somebody to make you."</p>
<p>The bricklayer laughed, then pointed with the shank of his pipe
to the two photographs over the mantelpiece, and said:</p>
<p>"See them? Them's me, with my dooks up. If any friend o' yourn
as is interested in the baiby comes to lay a 'and on me I'll see if
I've forgot 'ow to use 'em."</p>
<p>I felt the colour shuddering out of my cheeks, and putting baby
into the cot I turned on the man and cried:</p>
<p>"You scoundrel! The doctor has told me what is the immediate
cause of my baby's illness and your wife has confessed to giving
overdoses of a drug at your direction. If you don't leave this
house in one minute I'll go straight to the police-station and
charge you with poisoning my child."</p>
<p>The bully in the coward was cowed in a moment.</p>
<p>"Don't get 'uffy, ma'am," he said. "I'm the peaceablest man in
the East End, and if I mentioned anything about a friend o' yourn
it slipped out in the 'eat of the moment&mdash;see?"</p>
<p>"Out you go! Go! Go!" I cried, and, incredible as it may seem,
the man went flying before my face as if I had been a fury.</p>
<p>It would be a long tale to tell of what happened the day
following, the next and the next and the next&mdash;how baby became
less drowsy, but more restless; how being unable to retain her food
she grew thinner and thinner; how I wished to send for the doctor,
but dared not do so from fear of his fee; how the little money I
had left was barely sufficient to buy the food and stimulants which
were necessary to baby's cure: how I sat for long hours with my
little lamb on my lap straining my dry eyes into her face; and how
I cried to God for the life of my child, which was everything I had
or wanted.</p>
<p>All this time I was still lodging at the Jew's, returning to it
late every night, and leaving it early in the morning, but nothing
happened there that seemed to me of the smallest consequence. One
day Miriam, looking at me with her big black eyes, said:</p>
<p>"You must take more rest, dear, or you will make yourself
ill."</p>
<p>"No, no, I am not ill," I answered, and then remembering how
necessary my life was to the life of my child, I said, "I must not
be ill."</p>
<p>At last on the Saturday morning&mdash;I know now it must have
been Saturday, but time did not count with me then&mdash;I
overheard Mrs. Abramovitch pleading for me with her husband, saying
they knew I was in trouble and therefore I ought to have more time
to find lodging, another week&mdash;three days at all events. But
the stern-natured man with his rigid religion was inexorable. It
was God's will that I should be punished, and who was he to step in
between the All-high and his just retribution?</p>
<p>"The woman is displeasing to God," he said, and then he declared
that, the day being Sabbath (the two tall candlesticks and the
Sabbath loaves must have been under his eyes at the moment), he
would give me until nine o'clock that night, and if I had not moved
out by that time he would put my belongings into the street.</p>
<p>I remember that the Jew's threat made no impression upon my
mind. It mattered very little to me where I was to lodge next week
or what roof was to cover me.</p>
<p>When I reached the Olivers' that morning I found baby distinctly
worse. Even the brandy would not stay on her stomach and hence her
strength was plainly diminishing. I sat for some time looking
steadfastly into my child's face, and then I asked myself, as
millions of mothers must have done before me, why my baby should
suffer so. Why? Why? Why?</p>
<p>There seemed to be no answer to that question except one. Baby
was suffering because I was poor. If I had not been poor I could
have taken her into the country for fresh air and sunshine, where
she would have recovered as the doctor had so confidently assured
me.</p>
<p>And why was I poor? I was poor because I had refused to be
enslaved by my father's authority when it was vain and wrong, or my
husband's when it, was gross and cruel, and because I had obeyed
the highest that was in me&mdash;the call of love.</p>
<p>And now God looked down on the sufferings of my baby, who was
being killed for my conduct&mdash;killed by my poverty!</p>
<p>I tremble to say what wild impulses came at that thought. I felt
that if my baby died and I ever stood before God to be judged I
should judge Him in return. I should ask Him why, if He were
Almighty, He permitted the evil in the world to triumph over the
good, and if He were our heavenly Father why He allowed innocent
children to suffer? Was there any <i>human</i> father who could be
so callous, so neglectful, so cruel, as that?</p>
<p>I dare say it was a terrible thing to bring God to the bar of
judgment, to be judged by His poor weak ignorant creature; but it
was also terrible to sit with a dying baby on my lap (I thought
mine was dying), and to feel that there was nothing&mdash;not one
thing&mdash;I could do to relieve its sufferings.</p>
<p>My faith went down like a flood during the heavy hours of that
day&mdash;all that I had been taught to believe about God's
goodness and the marvellous efficacy of the Sacraments of His
Church.</p>
<p>I thought of the Sacrament of my marriage, which the Pope told
me had been sanctioned by my Redeemer under a natural law that
those who entered into it might live together in peace and
love&mdash;and then of my husband and his brutal infidelities.</p>
<p>I thought of the Sacrament of my baby's baptism, which was to
exorcise all the devils out of my child&mdash;and then of the worst
devil in the world, poverty, which was taking her very life.</p>
<p>After that a dark shadow crossed my soul, and I told myself that
since God was doing nothing, since He was allowing my only treasure
to be torn away from me, I would fight for my child's life as any
animal fights for her young.</p>
<p>By this time a new kind of despair had taken hold of me. It was
no longer the paralysing despair but the despair that has a driving
force in it.</p>
<p>"My child shall not die," I thought. "At least poverty shall not
kill her!"</p>
<p>Many times during the day I had heard Mrs. Oliver trying to
comfort me with various forms of sloppy sentiment. Children were a
great trial, they were allus makin' and keepin' people pore, and it
was sometimes better for the dears themselves to be in their
'eavenly Father's boosim.</p>
<p>I hardly listened. It was the same as if somebody were talking
to me in my sleep. But towards nightfall my deaf ear caught
something about myself&mdash;that "it" (I knew what that meant)
might be better for me, also, for then I should be free of
encumbrances and could marry again.</p>
<p>"Of course you could&mdash;you so young and good-lookin'. Only
the other day the person at number five could tell me as you were
the prettiest woman as comes up the Row, and the Vicar's wife
couldn't hold a candle to you. 'Fine feathers makes fine birds,'
says she: 'Give your young lady a nice frock and a bit o' colour in
her checks, and there ain't many as could best her in the West End
neither.'"</p>
<p>As the woman talked dark thoughts took possession of me. I began
to think of Angela. I tried not to, but I could not help it.</p>
<p>And then came the moment of <i>my</i> fiercest trial. With a
sense of Death hanging over my child I told myself that the only
way to drive it off was to make <i>some great sacrifice</i>.</p>
<p>Hitherto I had thought of everything I possessed as belonging to
baby, but now I felt that <i>I myself</i> belonged to her. I had
brought her into the world, and it was my duty to see that she did
not suffer.</p>
<p>All this time the inherited instinct of my religion was fighting
hard with me, and I was saying many Hail Marys to prevent myself
from doing what I meant to do.</p>
<p>"<i>Hail, Mary, full of grace: the Lord is with thee</i> . .
."</p>
<p>I felt as if I were losing my reason. But it was of no use
struggling against the awful impulse of self-sacrifice (for such I
thought it) which had taken hold of my mind, and at last it
conquered me.</p>
<p>"I must get money," I thought. "Unless I get money my child will
die. I&mdash;must&mdash;get&mdash;money."</p>
<p>Towards seven o'clock I got up, gave baby to Mrs. Oliver, put on
my coat and fixed with nervous fingers my hat and hatpins.</p>
<p>"Where are you going to, pore thing?" asked Mrs. Oliver.</p>
<p>"I am going out. I'll be back in the morning," I answered.</p>
<p>And then, after kneeling and kissing my baby again&mdash;my
sweet child, my Isabel&mdash;I tore the street door open, and
pulled it noisily behind me.</p>

<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_FOURTH_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_FOURTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>On reaching the front street, I may have taken the penny tram,
for though I had a sense of growing blind and deaf I have vague
memories of lights flashing past me and of the clanging of electric
cars.</p>
<p>At Bow Church I must have got out (probably to save a further
fare) because I recollect walking along the Bow Road between the
lights in the shops and the coarse flares from the stalls on the
edge of the pavement, where women with baskets on their arms were
doing their Saturday night's shopping.</p>
<p>My heart was still strong (sharpened indeed into, poignancy) and
I know I was not crying, for at one moment as I passed the mirror
in a chemist's window I caught sight of my face and it was fierce
as flame.</p>
<p>At another moment, while I was hurrying along, I collided with a
drunken woman who was coming out of a public-house with her arm
about the neck of a drunken sailor.</p>
<p>"Gawd! Here's the Verging Mary agine!" she cried.</p>
<p>It was the woman who had carried baby, and when I tried to hurry
past her she said:</p>
<p>"You think I'm drunk, don't you, dear? So'am. Don't you never
get drunk? No? What a bleedin' fool you are! Want to get out o'
this 'ere 'ole? Tike my tip then&mdash;gettin' drunk's on'y way out
of it."</p>
<p>Farther on I had to steer my way through jostling companies of
young people of both sexes who were going (I thought) the same way
as the woman&mdash;girls out of the factories with their free walk,
and their boisterous "fellers" from the breweries.</p>
<p>It was a cold and savage night. As I approached the side street
in which I lived I saw by the light of the arc lamps a small group
of people, a shivering straggle of audience, with the hunched-up
shoulders of beings thinly clad and badly fed, standing in stupid
silence at the corner while two persons wearing blue uniforms (a
man in a peaked cap and a young woman in a poke bonnet) sang a
Salvation hymn of which the refrain was "It is well, it is well
with my soul."</p>
<p>The door of the Jew's house was shut (for the first time in my
experience), so I had to knock and wait, and while I waited I could
not help but hear the young woman in the poke bonnet pray.</p>
<p>Her prayer was about "raising the standard of Calvary," and
making the drunkards and harlots of the East End into "seekers" and
"soul yielders" and "prisoners of the King of Kings."</p>
<p>Before the last words of the prayer were finished the man in the
peaked cap tossed up his voice in another hymn, and the young woman
joined him with an accordion:</p>
<p>"<i>Shall we gather at the river,<br />
Where bright angel feet have trod</i>. . . ."</p>
<p>The door was opened by the Jew himself, who, assuming a severe
manner, said something to me in his guttural voice which I did not
hear or heed, for I pushed past him and walked firmly upstairs.</p>
<p>When I had reached my room and lit the gas, I closed and locked
the door, as if I were preparing to commit a crime&mdash;and
perhaps I was.</p>
<p>I did not allow myself to think of what I intended to do that
night, but I knew quite well, and when at one moment my conscience
pressed me hard something cried out in my heart:</p>
<p>"Who can blame me since my child's life is in danger?"</p>
<p>I opened my trunk and took out my clothes&mdash;all that
remained of the dresses I had brought from Ellan. They were few,
and more than a little out of fashion, but one of them, though far
from gay, was bright and stylish&mdash;a light blue frock with a
high collar and some white lace over the bosom.</p>
<p>I remember wondering why I had not thought of pawning it during
the week, when I had had so much need of money, and then being glad
that I had not done so.</p>
<p>It was thin and light, being the dress I had worn on the day I
first came to the East End, carrying my baby to Ilford, when the
weather was warm which now was cold; but I paid no heed to that,
thinking only that it was my best and most attractive.</p>
<p>After I had put it on and glanced at myself in my little
swinging looking-glass I was pleased, but I saw at the same time
that my face was deadly pale, and that made me think of some
bottles and cardboard boxes which lay in the pockets of my
trunk.</p>
<p>I knew what they contained&mdash;the remains of the cosmetics
which I had bought in Cairo in the foolish days when I was trying
to make my husband love me. Never since then had I looked at them,
but now I took them out (with a hare's foot and some pads and
brushes) and began to paint my pale face&mdash;reddening my cracked
and colourless lips and powdering out the dark rings under my
eyes.</p>
<p>While I was doing this I heard (though I was trying not to) the
deadened sound of the singing in the front street, with the young
woman's treble voice above the man's bass and the wheezing of the
accordion:</p>
<p>"<i>Yes, we'll gather, at the river,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Where bright angel feet have
trod,</span><br />
With its, crystal tide for ever<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Flowing by the throne of
God."</span><br /></i></p>
<p>The Dark Spirit must have taken possession of me by this time,
poor vessel of conflicting passions as I was, for I remember that
while I listened I laughed&mdash;thinking what mockery was to sing
of "angel feet" and "crystal tides" to those shivering wretches at
the corner of the London street in the smoky night air.</p>
<p>"What a farce!" I thought. "What a heartless farce!"</p>
<p>Then I put on my hat, which was also not very gay, and taking
out of my trunk a pair of long light gloves which I had never worn
since I left Ellan, I began to pull them on.</p>
<p>I was standing before the looking-glass in the act of doing
this, and trying (God pity me!) to smile at myself, when I was
suddenly smitten by a new thought.</p>
<p>I was about to commit suicide&mdash;the worst kind of suicide,
not the suicide which is followed by oblivion, but by a life on
earth after death!</p>
<p>After that night Mary O'Neill would no longer exist! I should
never he able to think of her again! I should have killed her and
buried her and stamped the earth down on her and she would be gone
from me for ever!</p>
<p>That made a grip at my heart&mdash;awakening memories of happy
days in my childhood, bringing back the wild bliss of the short
period of my great love, and even making me think of my life in
Rome, with its confessions, its masses, and the sweetness of its
church bells.</p>
<p>I was saying farewell to Mary O'Neill! And parting with oneself
seemed so terrible that when I thought of it my heart seemed ready
to burst.</p>
<p>"But who can blame me when my child's life is in danger?" I
asked myself again, still tugging at my long gloves.</p>
<p>By the time I had finished dressing the Salvationists were going
off to their barracks with their followers behind them. Under the
singing I could faintly hear the shuffling of bad shoes, which made
a sound like the wash of an ebbing tide over the teeth of a rocky
beach&mdash;up our side street, past the Women's Night Shelter
(where the beds never had time to become cool), and beyond the
public-house with the placard in the window saying the ale sold
there could be guaranteed to make anybody drunk for fourpence.</p>
<p>"<i>We'll stand the storm, it won't be long,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And we'll anchor in the sweet
by-and-by."</span><br /></i></p>
<p>I listened and tried to laugh again, but I could not do so now.
There was one last spasm of my cruelly palpitating heart, in which
I covered my face with both hands, and cried:</p>
<p>"For baby's sake! For my baby's sake!"</p>
<p>And then I opened my bedroom door, walked boldly downstairs and
went out into the streets.</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM BY MARTIN CONRAD</p>
<p>I don't call it Chance that this was the very day of my return
to England.</p>
<p>If I had to believe that, I should have to disbelieve half of
what is best in the human story, and the whole of what we are
taught about a guiding Providence and the spiritual influences
which we cannot reason about and prove.</p>
<p>We were two days late arriving, having made dirty weather of it
in the Bay of Biscay, which injured our propeller and compelled us
to lie to, so I will not say that the sense of certainty which came
to me off Finisterre did not suffer a certain shock.</p>
<p>In fact the pangs of uncertainty grew so strongly upon me as we
neared home that in the middle of the last night of our voyage I
went to O'Sullivan's cabin, and sat on the side of his bunk for
hours, talking of the chances of my darling being lost and of the
possibility of finding her.</p>
<p>O'Sullivan, God bless him, was "certain sure" that everything
would be right, and he tried to take things gaily.</p>
<p>"The way I'm knowing she'll be at Southampton in a new hat and
feather! So mind yer oi, Commanther."</p>
<p>We passed the Channel Islands in the spring of morning, and at
breakfast-time we picked up the pilot, who had brought out a group
of reporters. I did my best for the good chaps (though it is mighty
hard to talk about exploring when you are thinking of another
subject), and then handed them over to my shipmates.</p>
<p>Towards seven o'clock at night we heaved up to the grey stone
pier at the head of Southampton Water. It was then dark, so being
unable to see more than the black forms and waving hands of the
crowd waiting for us with the lights behind them, I arranged with
O'Sullivan that he should slip ashore as soon as we got alongside,
and see if he could find my dear one.</p>
<p>"Will you remember her face?" I asked.</p>
<p>"And why wouldn't I? By the stars of God, there's only one of it
in the world," he answered.</p>
<p>The welcome we got when we were brought to was enough to make a
vain man proud, and a modest one ashamed, and perhaps I should have
had a little of both feelings if the right woman had been there to
share them.</p>
<p>My state-room was on the promenade deck, and I stood at the door
of it as long as I dared, raising my cap at the call of my name,
but feeling as if I were the loneliest man in the world, God help
me!</p>
<p>O'Sullivan had not returned when Treacle came to say that
everything was ready, and it was time to go ashore.</p>
<p>I will not say that I was not happy to be home; I will not
pretend that the warm-hearted welcome did not touch me; but God
knows there was a moment when, for want of a face I did not see, I
could have turned about and gone back to the South Pole there and
then, without an instant's hesitation.</p>
<p>When I got ashore I had as much as I could do to stand
four-square to the storm of hand-shaking that fell on me. And
perhaps if I had been in better trim I should have found lots of
fun in the boyish delight of my shipmates in being back, with old
Treacle shaking hands with everybody from the Mayor of the town to
the messenger-boys (crying "What cheer, matey?"), while the
scientific staff were bringing up their wives to be introduced to
me, just as the lower-form fellows used to do with their big
sisters at school.</p>
<p>At last O'Sullivan came back with a long face to say he could
see nothing of my dear one, and then I braced myself and said:</p>
<p>"Never mind! She'll be waiting for us in London perhaps."</p>
<p>It took a shocking time to pass through the Customs, but we got
off at last in a special train commissioned by our
chairman&mdash;half of our company with their wives and a good many
reporters having crammed themselves into the big saloon carriage
reserved for me.</p>
<p>At the last moment somebody threw a sheaf of evening papers
through my window, and as soon as we were well away I took up one
of them and tried to read it, but column after column fell blank on
my eyes, for my mind was full of other matters.</p>
<p>The talk in the carriage, too, did not interest me in the least.
It was about the big, hustling, resonant world, general elections,
the fall of ministries, Acts of Parliament, and the Lord knows
what&mdash;things that had looked important when we were in the
dumb solitude of Winter Quarters, but seemed to be of no account
now when I was hungering for something else.</p>
<p>At last I got a quiet pressman in a corner and questioned him
about Ellan.</p>
<p>"That's my native island, you know&mdash;anything going on
there?"</p>
<p>The reporter said yes, there was some commotion about the
failure of banks, with the whole island under a cloud, and its
biggest financial man gone smash.</p>
<p>"Is his name O'Neill?" I asked.</p>
<p>"That's it."</p>
<p>"Anything else happened there while I've been away?"</p>
<p>"No . . . yes . . . well, now that I think of it, there was a
big scare a year or so ago about a young peeress who disappeared
mysteriously."</p>
<p>"Was . . . was it Lady Raa?"</p>
<p>"Yes," said the reporter, and then (controlling myself as well
as I could) I listened to a rapid version of what had become known
about my dear one down to the moment when she "vanished as utterly
as if she had been dropped into the middle of the Irish Sea."</p>
<p>It is of no use saying what I felt after that, except that
flying in an express train to London, I was as impatient of space
and time as if I had been in a ship down south stuck fast in the
rigid besetment of the ice.</p>
<p>I could not talk, and I dared not think, so I shouted for a
sing-song, and my shipmates (who had been a little low at seeing me
so silent) jumped at the proposal like schoolboys let loose from
school.</p>
<p>Of course O'Sullivan gave us "The Minsthrel Boy"; and Treacle
sang "Yew are the enny"; and then I, yes I (Oh, God!), sang
"Sally's the gel," and every man of my company joined in the
ridiculous chorus.</p>
<p>Towards ten o'clock we changed lines on the loop at Waterloo and
ran into Charing Cross, where we found another and still bigger
crowd of hearty people behind a barrier, with a group of my
committee, my fellow explorers, and geographers in general, waiting
on the platform.</p>
<p>I could not help it if I made a poor return to their
warm-hearted congratulations, for my eyes were once more searching
for a face I could not see, so that I was glad and relieved when I
heard the superintendent say that the motor-car that was to take me
to the hotel was ready and waiting.</p>
<p>But just then O'Sullivan came up and whispered that a priest and
a nun were asking to speak to me, and he believed they had news of
Mary.</p>
<p>The priest proved to be dear old Father Dan, and the nun to be
Sister Veronica, whom my dear one calls Mildred. At the first sight
of their sad-joyful faces something gripped me by the throat, for I
knew what they had come to say before they said it&mdash;that my
darling was lost, and Father Dan (after some priestly qualms) had
concluded that I was the first man who ought to be told of it.</p>
<p>Although this was exactly what I had expected, it fell on me
like a thunderbolt, and in spite of the warmth of my welcome home,
I believe in my soul I was the most downhearted man alive.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I bundled Father Dan and the Sister and O'Sullivan
into the automobile, and jumping in after them, told the chauffeur
to drive like the deuce to the hotel.</p>
<p>He could not do that, though, for the crowd in the station-yard
surrounded the car and shouted for a speech. I gave them one,
saying heaven knows what, except that their welcome made me ashamed
of not having got down to the Pole, but please God I should get
there next time or leave my bones on the way.</p>
<p>We got to the hotel at last (the same that my poor stricken
darling had stayed at after her honeymoon), and as soon as we
reached my room I locked the door and said:</p>
<p>"Now out with it. And please tell me everything."</p>
<p>Father Dan was the first to speak, but his pulpit style was too
slow for me in my present stress of thoughts and feelings. He had
hardly got further than his difference with his Bishop, and the
oath he had sworn by him who died for us to come to London and
never go back until he had found my darling, when I shook his old
hand and looked towards the Sister.</p>
<p>She was quicker by a good deal, and in a few minutes I knew
something of my dear one's story&mdash;how she had fled from home
on my account, and for my sake had become poor; how she had lodged
for a while in Bloomsbury; how hard she had been hit by the report
of the loss of my ship; and how (Oh my poor, suffering, heroic,
little woman!) she had disappeared on the approach of another event
of still more serious consequence.</p>
<p>It was no time for modesty, not from me at all events, so while
the Father's head was down, I asked plainly if there was a child,
and was told there was, and the fear of having it taken from her (I
could understand that) was perhaps the reason my poor darling had
hidden herself away.</p>
<p>"And now, when, where, and by whom was she seen last?" I
asked.</p>
<p>"Last week, and again to-day, to-night, here in the West
End&mdash;by a fallen woman," answered the Sister.</p>
<p>"And what conclusion do you draw from that?"</p>
<p>The Sister hesitated for a moment and then said:</p>
<p>"That her child is dead; that she does not know you are alive;
and that she is throwing herself away, thinking there is nothing
left to live for."</p>
<p>"What?" I cried. "You believe that? Because she left that brute
of a husband . . . and because she came to me . . . you believe
that she could. . . . Never! Not Mary O'Neill! She would beg her
bread, or die in the streets first."</p>
<p>I dare say my thickening voice was betraying me; but when I
looked at Mildred and saw the tears rolling down her cheeks and
heard her excuses (it was "what hundreds of poor women were driven
to every day"), I was ashamed and said so, and she put her kind
hand in my hand in token of her forgiveness.</p>
<p>"But what's to be done now?" she asked.</p>
<p>O'Sullivan was for sending for the police, but I would not hear
of that. I was beginning to feel as I used to do when I lost a
comrade in a blizzard down south, and (without a fact or a clue to
guide me) sent a score of men in a broad circle from the camp (like
spokes in a wheel) to find him or follow back on their tracks.</p>
<p>There were only four of us, but I mapped out our courses, where
we were to go, when we were to return, and what we were to do if
any of us found my lost one&mdash;take her to Sister's flat, which
she gave the address of.</p>
<p>It was half-past eleven when we started on our search, and I
dare say our good old Father Dan, after his fruitless journeys,
thought it a hopeless quest. But I had found myself at last. My
spirits which had been down to zero had gone up with a bound. I had
no ghost of an idea that I had been called home from the 88th
latitude for nothing. And I had no fear that I had come too
late.</p>
<p>Call it frenzy if you like&mdash;I don't much mind what people
call it. But I was as sure as I have ever been of anything in this
life, or ever expect to be, that the sufferings of my poor martyred
darling were at an end, and that within an hour I should be holding
her in my arms.</p>

<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_FIFTH_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_FIFTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>There must be a physical power in fierce emotion to deprive us
of the use of our senses of hearing and even of sight, for my
memory of what happened after I left the Jew's has blank places in
it.</p>
<p>Trying to recall the incidents of that night is like travelling
on a moorland road under a flying moon, with sometimes the whitest
light in which everything is clearly seen, and then the blackest
darkness.</p>
<p>I remember taking the electric car going west, and seeing the
Whitechapel Road shooting by me, with its surging crowds of
pedestrians, its public-houses, its Cinema shows, and its Jewish
theatres.</p>
<p>I remember getting down at Aldgate Pump, and walking through
that dead belt of the City, which, lying between east and west, is
alive like a beehive by day and silent and deserted by night.</p>
<p>I remember seeing an old man, with a face like a rat's, picking
up cigar-ends from the gutters before the dark Banks, and then a
flock of sheep bleating before a barking dog as they were driven
through the echoing streets from the river-side towards the
slaughter-houses near Smithfield Market.</p>
<p>I remember that when I came to St. Paul's the precincts of the
cathedral were very quiet and the big clock was striking nine. But
on Ludgate Hill the traffic was thick, and when I reached Fleet
Street crowds of people were standing in front of the newspaper
offices, reading large placards in written characters which were
pasted on the windows.</p>
<p>I remember that I did not look at these placards, thinking their
news was nothing to me, who had not seen a newspaper for months and
for whom the world was now eclipsed, but that as I stepped round
one of the crowds, which extended to the middle of the street,
somebody said:</p>
<p>"He has landed at Southampton, it seems."</p>
<p>I remember that when I reached Charing Cross I found myself on
the fringe of another and much larger crowd, and that the people,
who seemed to be waiting for somebody and were chatting with a
noise like the crackling of thorns under a pot, were saying:</p>
<p>"His train is fifty minutes late, so we've half an hour to wait
yet."</p>
<p>Then I remember that walking at random round St Martin's Church
into Leicester Square I came upon three "public women" who were
swinging along with a high step and laughing loudly, and that one
of them was Angela, and that she stopped on seeing me and
cried:</p>
<p>"Hello! Here I am again, you see! <i>Giovanni's dead, and I
don't care a damn!</i>"</p>
<p>I remember that she said something else&mdash;it was about
Sister Mildred, but my mind did not take it in&mdash;and at the
next moment she left me, and I heard her laughter once more as she
swept round the corner.</p>
<p>I hardly know what happened next, for here comes one of the
blank places in my memory, with nothing to light it except vague
thoughts of Martin (and that soulless night in Bloomsbury when the
newspapers announced that he was lost), until, wandering aimlessly
through streets and streets of people&mdash;such multitudes of
people, no end of people&mdash;I found myself back at Charing
Cross.</p>
<p>The waiting crowd was now larger and more excited than before,
and the traffic at both sides of the station was stopped.</p>
<p>"He's coming! He's coming! Here he is!" the people cried, and
then there were deafening shouts and cheers.</p>
<p>I recall the sight of a line of policemen pushing people back (I
was myself pushed back); I recall the sight of a big motor-car
containing three men and a woman, ploughing its way through; I
recall the sight of one of the men raising his cap; of the crowd
rushing to shake hands with him; then of the car swinging away, and
of the people running after it with a noise like that of the racing
of a noisy river.</p>
<p>It is the literal truth that never once did I ask myself what
this tumult was about, and that for some time after it was
over&mdash;a full hour at least&mdash;I had a sense of walking in
my sleep, as if my body were passing through the streets of the
West End of London while my soul was somewhere else altogether.</p>
<p>Thus at one moment, as I was going by the National Gallery and
thought I caught the sound of Martin's name, I felt as if I were
back in Glen Raa, and it was I myself who had been calling it.</p>
<p>At another moment, when I was standing at the edge of the
pavement in Piccadilly Circus, which was ablaze with electric light
and thronged with people (for the theatres and music-halls were
emptying, men in uniform were running about with whistles,
policemen were directing the traffic, and streams of carriages were
flowing by), I felt as if I were back in my native island, where I
was alone on the dark shore while the sea was smiting me.</p>
<p>Again, after a brusque voice had said, "Move on, please," I
followed the current of pedestrians down Piccadilly&mdash;it must
have been Piccadilly&mdash;and saw lines of "public women," chiefly
French and Belgian, sauntering along, and heard men throwing light
words to them as they went by, I was thinking of the bleating sheep
and the barking dog.</p>
<p>And again, when I was passing a men's club and the place where I
had met Angela, my dazed mind was harking back to Ilford (with a
frightened sense of the length of time since I had been
there&mdash;"Good heavens, it must be five hours at least!"), and
wondering if Mrs. Oliver was giving baby her drops of brandy and
her spoonfuls of diluted milk.</p>
<p>But somewhere about midnight my soul seemed to take full
possession of my body, and I saw things clearly and sharply as I
turned out of Oxford Street into Regent Street.</p>
<p>The traffic was then rapidly dying down, the streets were
darker, the caf&eacute;s were closing, men and women were coming
Pout of supper rooms, smoking cigarettes, getting into taxis and
driving away; and another London day was passing into another
night.</p>
<p>People spoke to me. I made no answer. At one moment an elderly
woman said something to which I replied, "No, no," and hurried on.
At another moment, a foreign-looking man addressed me, and I pushed
past without replying. Then a string of noisy young fellows,
stretching across the broad pavement arm-in-arm, encircled me and
cried:</p>
<p>"Here we are, my dear. Let's have a kissing-bee."</p>
<p>But with angry words and gestures I compelled them to let me go,
whereupon one of the foreign women who were sauntering by said
derisively:</p>
<p>"What does she think she's out for, I wonder?"</p>
<p>At length I found myself standing under a kind of loggia at the
corner of Piccadilly Circus, which was now half-dark, the theatres
and music-halls being closed, and only one group of arc lamps
burning on an island about a statue.</p>
<p>There were few people now where there had been so dense a crowd
awhile ago; policemen were tramping leisurely along; horse-cabs
were going at walking pace, and taxis were moving slowly; but a few
gentlemen (walking home from their clubs apparently) were passing
at intervals, often looking at me, and sometimes speaking as they
went by.</p>
<p>Then plainly and pitilessly the taunt of the foreign woman came
back to me&mdash;what was I there for?</p>
<p>I knew quite well, and yet I saw that not only was I not doing
what I came out to do, but every time an opportunity had offered I
had resisted it. It was just as if an inherited instinct of
repulsion had restrained me, or some strong unseen arm had always
snatched me away.</p>
<p>This led me&mdash;was it some angel leading me?&mdash;to think
again of Martin and to remember our beautiful and sacred parting at
Castle Raa.</p>
<p>"Whatever happens to either of us, we belong to each other for
ever," he had said, and I had answered, "For ever and ever."</p>
<p>It was a fearful shock to think of this now. I saw that if I did
what I had come out to do, not only would Mary O'Neill be dead to
me after to-night, but Martin Conrad would be dead also.</p>
<p>When I thought of that I realised that, although I had accepted,
without question, the newspaper reports of Martin's death, he had
never hitherto been dead to me at all. He had lived with me every
moment of my life since, supporting me, sustaining me and inspiring
me, so that nothing I had ever done&mdash;not one single
thing&mdash;would have been different if I had believed him to be
alive and been sure that he was coming back.</p>
<p>But now I was about to kill Martin Conrad as well as Mary
O'Neill, by breaking the pledge (sacred as any sacrament) which
they had made for life and for eternity.</p>
<p>Could I do that? In this hideous way too? Never! Never! Never! I
should die in the streets first.</p>
<p>I remember that I was making a movement to go back to Ilford
(God knows how), when, on the top of all my brave thinking, came
the pitiful thought of my child. My poor helpless little baby, who
had made no promise and was party to no pledge. She needed
nourishment and fresh air and sunshine, and if she could not get
them&mdash;if I went back to her penniless&mdash;she would die!</p>
<p>My sweet darling! My Isabel, my only treasure! Martin's child
and mine!</p>
<p>That put a quick end to all my qualms. Again I bit my lip until
it bled, and told myself that I should speak to the Very next man
who came along.</p>
<p>"Yes, the very next man who comes along," I thought.</p>
<p>I was standing at that moment in the shadow of one of the
pilasters of the loggia, almost leaning against it, and in the
silence of the street I heard distinctly the sharp firm step of
somebody coming my way.</p>
<p>It was a man. As he came near me he slowed down, and stopped. He
was then immediately behind me. I heard his quick breathing. I felt
that his eyes were fixed on me. One sidelong glance told me that he
was wearing a long ulster and a cap, that he was young, tall,
powerfully built, had a strong, firm, clean-shaven face, and an
indescribable sense of the open air about him.</p>
<p>"Now, now!" I thought, and (to prevent myself from running away)
I turned quickly round to him and tried to speak.</p>
<p>But I said nothing. I did not know what women say to men under
such circumstances. I found myself trembling violently, and before
I was aware of what was happening I had burst into tears.</p>
<p>Then came another blinding moment and a tempest of conflicting
feelings.</p>
<p>I felt that the man had laid hold of me, that his strong hands
were grasping my arms, and that he was looking into my face. I
heard his voice. It seemed to belong to no waking moment but to
come out of the hours of sleep.</p>
<p>"Mary! Mary!"</p>
<p>I looked up at him, but before my eyes could carry the news to
my brain I knew who it was&mdash;I knew, I knew, I knew!</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid! It's I!"</p>
<p>Then something&mdash;God knows what&mdash;made me struggle to
escape, and I cried:</p>
<p>"Let me go!"</p>
<p>But even while I was struggling&mdash;trying to fly away from my
greatest happiness&mdash;I was praying with all my might that the
strong arms would hold me, conquer me, master me.</p>
<p>They did. And then something seemed to give way within my head,
and through a roaring that came into my brain I heard the voice
again, and it was saying:</p>
<p>"Quick, Sister, call a cab. Open the door, O'Sullivan. No, leave
her to me. I've got her, thank God!"</p>
<p>And then blinding darkness fell over me and everything was
blotted out.</p>
<p>But only a moment afterwards (or what seemed to be a moment)
memory came back in a great swelling wave of joy. Though I did not
open my eyes I knew that I was safe and baby was safe, and all was
well. Somebody&mdash;it was the same beloved voice again&mdash;was
saying:</p>
<p>"Mally! My Mally! My poor, long-suffering darling! My own again,
God bless her!"</p>
<p>It was he, it was Martin, my Martin. And, oh Mother of my Lord,
he was carrying me upstairs in his arms.</p>

CHAPTER</h2>
<p>My return to consciousness was a painful, yet joyful experience.
It was almost like being flung in a frail boat out of a tempestuous
sea into a quiet harbour.</p>
<p>I seemed to hear myself saying, "My child shall not die. Poverty
shall not kill her. I am going to take her into the country . . .
she will recover. . . . No, no, it is not Martin. Martin is dead. .
. . But his eyes . . . don't you see his eyes. . . . Let me
go."</p>
<p>Then all the confused sense of nightmare seemed to be carried
away as by some mighty torrent, and there came a great calm, a kind
of morning sweetness, with the sun shining through my closed
eyelids, and not a sound in my ears but the thin carolling of a
bird.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes I was in bed in a room that was strange to
me. It was a little like the Reverend Mother's room in Rome, having
pictures of the Saints on the walls, and a large figure of the
Sacred Heart over the mantelpiece; but there was a small gas fire,
and a canary singing in a gilded cage that hung in front of the
window.</p>
<p>I was trying to collect my senses in order to realize where I
was when Sister Mildred's kind face, in her white wimple and
gorget, leaned over me, and she said, with a tender smile, "You are
awake now, my child?"</p>
<p>Then memory came rushing back, and though the immediate past was
still like a stormy dream I seemed to remember everything.</p>
<p>"Is it true that I saw. . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes," said Mildred.</p>
<p>"Then he was not shipwrecked?"</p>
<p>"That was a false report. Within a month or two the newspapers
had contradicted it."</p>
<p>"Where is he?" I asked, rising from my pillow.</p>
<p>"Hush! Lie quiet. You are not to excite yourself. I must call
the doctor."</p>
<p>Mildred was about to leave the room, but I could not let her
go.</p>
<p>"Wait! I must ask you something more."</p>
<p>"Not now, my child. Lie down."</p>
<p>"But I must. Dear Sister, I must. There is somebody else."</p>
<p>"You mean the baby," said Mildred, in a low voice.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"She has been found, and taken to the country, and is getting
better rapidly. So lie down, and be quiet," said Mildred, and with
a long breath of happiness I obeyed.</p>
<p>A moment afterwards I heard her speaking to somebody over the
telephone (saying I had recovered consciousness and was almost
myself again), and then some indistinct words came hack in the
thick telephone voice like that of a dumb man shouting down a
tunnel, followed by sepulchral peals of merry laughter.</p>
<p>"The doctor will be here presently," said Mildred, returning to
me with a shining face.</p>
<p>"And . . . he?"</p>
<p>"Yes, perhaps he will be permitted to come, too."</p>
<p>She was telling me how baby had been discovered&mdash;by means
of Mrs. Oliver's letter which had been found in my
pocket&mdash;when there was the whirr of an electric bell in the
corridor outside, followed (as soon as Mildred could reach the
door) by the rich roll of an Irish voice.</p>
<p>It was Dr. O'Sullivan, and in a moment he was standing by my
bed, his face ablaze with smiles.</p>
<p>"By the Saints of heaven, this is good, though," he said. "It's
worth a hundred dozen she is already of the woman we brought here
first."</p>
<p>"That was last night, wasn't it?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Well, not last night exactly," he answered. And then I gathered
that I had been ill, seriously ill, being two days unconscious, and
that Martin had been in a state of the greatest anxiety.</p>
<p>"He's coming, isn't he?" I said. "Will he be here soon? How does
he look? Is he well? Did he finish his work?"</p>
<p>"Now, now, now," said the doctor, with uplifted hands. "If it's
exciting yourself like this you're going to be, it isn't myself
that will he taking the risk of letting him come at all."</p>
<p>But after I had pleaded and prayed and promised to be good he
consented to allow Martin to see me, and then it was as much as I
could do not to throw my arms about his neck and kiss him.</p>
<p>I had not noticed what Mildred was doing during this time, and
almost before I was aware of it somebody else had entered the
room.</p>
<p>It was dear old Father Dan.</p>
<p>"Glory be to God!" he cried at sight of me, and then he
said:</p>
<p>"Don't worry, my daughter, now don't worry,"&mdash;with that
nervous emphasis which I knew by long experience to be the surest
sign of my dear Father's own perturbation.</p>
<p>I did not know then, or indeed until long afterwards, that for
six months past he had been tramping the streets of London in
search of me (day after day, and in the dark of the night and the
cold of the morning); but something in his tender old face, which
was seamed and worn, so touched me with the memory of the last
scene in my mother's room that my eyes began to overflow, and
seeing this he began to laugh and let loose his Irish tongue on
us.</p>
<p>"My blissing on you, doctor! It's the mighty proud man ye'll be
entoirely to be saving the life of the swatest woman in the world.
And whisha, Sister, if ye have a nip of something neat anywhere
handy, faith it isn't my cloth will prevent me from drinking the
health of everybody."</p>
<p>If this was intended to cheer me up it failed completely, for
the next thing I knew was that the doctor was bustling the dear old
Father out of the room, and that Mildred was going out after
him.</p>
<p>She left the door open, though, and as soon as I had calmed down
a little I listened intently for every sound outside.</p>
<p>It was then that I heard the whirr of the electric bell again,
but more softly this time, and followed by breathless whispered
words in the corridor (as of some one who had been running) and
once more . . . I knew, I knew, I knew!</p>
<p>After a moment Mildred came to ask me in a whisper if I was
quite sure that I could control myself, and though my heart was
thumping against my breast, I answered Yes.</p>
<p>Then I called for a hand-glass and made my hair a shade neater,
and after that I closed my eyes (God knows why) and waited.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence, dead silence, and then&mdash;then
I opened my eyes and saw him standing in the open doorway.</p>
<p>His big, strong, bronzed face&mdash;stronger than ever now, and
marked with a certain change from the struggles he had gone
through&mdash;was utterly broken up. For some moments he did not
speak, but I could see that he saw the change that life had made in
me also. Then in a low voice, so low that it was like the breath of
his soul, he said:</p>
<p>"Forgive me! Forgive me!"</p>
<p>And stepping forward he dropped to his knees by the side of my
bed, and kissed the arms and hands I was stretching out to him.</p>
<p>That was more than I could bear, and the next thing I heard was
my darling's great voice crying:</p>
<p>"Sister! Sister! Some brandy! Quick! She has fainted."</p>
<p>But my poor little fit of hysterics was soon at an end, and
though Martin was not permitted to stay more than a moment longer,
a mighty wave of happiness flowed over me, such as I had never
known before and may never know again.</p>

<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_SEVENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_SEVENTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>I had such a beautiful convalescence. For the major operations
of the Great Surgeon an an&aelig;sthetic has not yet been found,
but within a week I was sitting up again, mutilated, perhaps, but
gloriously alive and without the whisper of a cry.</p>
<p>By this time Father Dan had gone back to Ellan (parting from me
with a solemn face as he said, "Lord, now lettest Thou Thy servant
depart in peace"), and Sister Mildred had obtained permission to
give up one of her rooms to me as long as I should need it.</p>
<p>Martin came to see me every day, first for five minutes, then
ten, and finally for a quarter and even half an hour. He brought
such an atmosphere of health with him, that merely to hold his hand
seemed to give me new strength&mdash;being so pale and bloodless
now that I thought the sun might have shone through me as through a
sea-gull.</p>
<p>I could scarcely believe it was not a dream that he was sitting
by my side, and sometimes I felt as if I had to touch him to make
sure he was there.</p>
<p>How he talked to keep up my spirits! It was nearly always about
his expedition (never about me or my experiences, for that seemed a
dark scene from which he would not draw the curtain), and I was all
a-tremble as I listened to the story of his hair-breadth escapes,
though he laughed and made so light of them.</p>
<p>It nearly broke my heart that he had not got down to the Pole;
and when he told me that it was the sense of my voice calling to
him which had brought him back from the 88th latitude, I felt as if
I had been a coward, unworthy of the man who loved me.</p>
<p>Sometimes he talked about baby&mdash;he called her
"Girlie"&mdash;telling a funny story of how he had carried her off
from Ilford, where the bricklayer had suddenly conceived such a
surprising affection for my child ("what he might go so far as to
call a fatherly feeling") that he had been unwilling to part with
her until soothed down by a few sovereigns&mdash;not to say
frightened by a grasp of Martin's iron hand which had nearly broken
his wrist.</p>
<p>"She's as right as a trivet now, though," said Martin, "and I'll
run down to Chevening every other day to see how she's getting
on."</p>
<p>My darling was in great demand from the first, but when he could
not be with me in the flesh he was with me in the spirit, by means
of the newspapers which Mildred brought up in armfuls.</p>
<p>I liked the illustrated ones best, with their pictures of scenes
in the Expedition, particularly the portraits of Martin himself in
his Antarctic outfit, with his broad throat, determined lips, clear
eyes, and that general resemblance to the people we all know which
makes us feel that the great men of every age are brothers of one
family.</p>
<p>But what literary tributes there were, too! What interviews,
what articles! A member of the scientific staff had said that "down
there," with Nature in her wrath, where science was nothing and
even physical strength was not all, only one thing really counted,
and that was the heroic soul, and because Martin had it, he had
always been the born leader of them all.</p>
<p>And then, summing up the tangible gains of the Expedition, the
<i>Times</i> said its real value was moral and spiritual, because
it showed that in an age when one half of the world seemed to be
thinking of nothing but the acquisition of wealth (that made me
think of my father) and the other half of nothing but the pursuit
of pleasure (that reminded me of my husband and Alma), there could
be found men like Martin Conrad and his dauntless comrades who had
faced death for the sake of an ideal and were ready to do so
again.</p>
<p>Oh dear! what showers of tears I shed over those newspapers! But
the personal honours that were bestowed on Martin touched me most
of all.</p>
<p>First, the Royal Geographical Society held a meeting at the
Albert Hall, where the Gold Medal was presented to him. I was in a
fever of anxiety on the night of that function, I remember, until
Dr. O'Sullivan (heaven bless, him!) came flying upstairs, to tell
me that it had been a "splendid success," and Martin's speech (he
hadn't prepared a word of it) "a perfect triumph."</p>
<p>Then some of the Universities conferred degrees on my darling,
which was a source of inexpressible amusement to him, especially
when (after coming back from Edinburgh) he marched up and down my
room in his Doctor's cap and gown, and I asked him to spell
"promise" and he couldn't.</p>
<p>Oh, the joy of it all! It was so great a joy that at length it
became a pain.</p>
<p>The climax came when the Home Secretary wrote to say that the
King had been graciously pleased to confer a Knighthood upon
Martin, in recognition of his splendid courage and the substantial
contribution he had already made to the material welfare of the
world.</p>
<p>That frightened me terribly, though only a woman would know why.
It was one thing to share the honours of the man I loved (however
secretly and as it were by stealth), but quite another thing to
feel that they were carrying him away from me, drawing him off,
lifting him up, and leaving me far below.</p>
<p>When the sense of this became acute I used to sit at night, when
Mildred was out at her work, by the lofty window of her room,
looking down on the precincts of Piccadilly, and wondering how much
my darling really knew about the impulse that took me there, and
how nearly (but for the grace of God) its awful vortex had
swallowed me up.</p>
<p>It was then that I began to write these notes (having persuaded
Mildred to buy me this big book with its silver clasp and key), not
intending at first to tell the whole story of my life, but only to
explain to him for whom everything has been written (what I could
not bring myself to say face to face), how it came to pass that I
was tempted to that sin which is the most awful crime against her
sex that a woman can commit.</p>
<p>Three months had gone by this time, the spring was coming and I
was beginning to feel that Martin (who had not yet been home) was
being kept in London on my account, when Dr. O'Sullivan announced
that I was well enough to be moved, and that a little of my native
air would do me good.</p>
<p>Oh, the thrill that came with that prospect! I suppose there is
a sort of call to one's heart from the soil that gave one birth,
but in my case it was coupled with a chilling thought of the poor
welcome I should receive there, my father's house being closed to
me and my husband's abandoned for ever.</p>
<p>The very next morning, however, there came a letter from Father
Dan, giving me all the news of Ellan: some of it sad enough, God
knows (about the downfall of my father's financial schemes); some
of it deliciously wicked, such as it would have required an angel
not to rejoice in (about the bad odour in which Alma and my husband
were now held, making the pendulum of popular feeling swing back in
my direction); and some of it utterly heart-breaking in its
assurances of the love still felt for me in my native place.</p>
<p>Of course the sweetest part of that came from Christian Ann,
who, after a stiff fight with her moral principles, had said that
whatever I had done I was as "pure as the mountain turf," and, who
then charged Father Dan with the message that "Mary O'Neill's
little room" was waiting for her still.</p>
<p>This settled everything&mdash;everything except one thing, and
that was the greatest thing of all. But when Martin came later the
same day, having received the same message, and declared his
intention of taking me home, there seemed to be nothing left to
wish for in earth or heaven.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I shouldn't have been a woman If I had not
coquetted with my great happiness, so when Martin had finished I
said:</p>
<p>"But dare you?"</p>
<p>"Dare I&mdash;what?" said Martin.</p>
<p>"Dare you go home . . . with <i>me</i>?"</p>
<p>I knew what I wanted him to say, and he said it like a
darling.</p>
<p>"Look here, Mary, I'm just spoiling for a sight of the little
island, and the old people are destroyed at not seeing me; but if I
can't go back with you, by the Lord God! I'll never go back at
all."</p>
<p>I wanted to see baby before going away, but that was forbidden
me.</p>
<p>"Wait until you're well enough, and we'll send her after you,"
said Dr. O'Sullivan.</p>
<p>So the end of it all was that inside a week I was on my way to
Ellan, not only with Martin, but also with Mildred, who, being a
little out of health herself, had been permitted to take me
home.</p>
<p>Shall I ever forget our arrival at Blackwater! The steamer we
sailed in was streaming with flags from stem to stern, and as she
slid up the harbour the dense crowds that packed the pier from end
to end seemed frantic with excitement. Such shouting and cheering!
Such waving of hats and handkerchiefs!</p>
<p>There was a sensible pause, I thought, a sort of hush, when the
gangway being run down, Martin was seen to give his arm to me, and
I was recognised as the lost and dishonoured one.</p>
<p>But even that only lasted for a moment, it was almost as if the
people felt that this act of Martin's was of a piece with the
sacred courage that had carried him down near to the Pole, for
hardly had he brought me ashore, and put me into the automobile
waiting to take us away, when the cheering broke out into almost
delirious tumult.</p>
<p>I knew it was all for Martin, but not even the humility of my
position, and the sense of my being an added cause of my darling's
glory, could make me otherwise than proud and happy.</p>
<p>We drove home, with the sunset in our faces, over the mountain
road which I had crossed with my husband on the day of my marriage;
and when we came to our own village I could not help seeing that a
little&mdash;just a little&mdash;of the welcome waiting for us was
meant for me.</p>
<p>Father Dan was there. He got into the car and sat by my side;
and then some of the village women, who had smartened themselves up
in their Sunday clothes, reached over and shook hands with me,
speaking about things I had said and done as a child and had long
forgotten.</p>
<p>We had to go at a walking pace the rest of the way, and while
Martin saluted old friends (he remembered everybody by name) Father
Dan talked in my ear about the "domestic earthquake" that had been
going on at Sunny Lodge, everything topsy-turvy until to-day, the
little room being made ready for me, and the best bedroom (the
doctor's and Christian Ann's) for Martin, and the "loft" over the
dairy for the old people themselves&mdash;as if their beloved son
had been good in not forgetting them, and had condescended in
coming home.</p>
<p>"Is it true?" they had asked each other. "Is he really, really
coming?" "What does he like to eat, mother?" "What does he drink?"
"What does he smoke?"</p>
<p>I had to close my eyes as I came near the gate of my father's
house, and, except for the rumbling of the river under the bridge
and the cawing of the rooks in the elms, I should not have known
when we were there.</p>
<p>The old doctor (his face overflowing with happiness, and his
close-cropped white head bare, as if he had torn out of the house
at the toot of our horn) met us as we turned into the lane, and for
the little that was left of our journey he walked blithely as a boy
by the car, at the side on which Martin sat.</p>
<p>I reached forward to catch the first sight of Sunny Lodge, and
there it was behind its fuchsia hedge, which was just breaking into
bloom.</p>
<p>There was Christian Ann, too, at the gate in her sunbonnet; and
before the automobile had come to a stand Martin was out of it and
had her in his arms.</p>
<p>I knew what that meant to the dear sweet woman, and for a moment
my spirits failed me, because it flashed upon my mind that perhaps
her heart had only warmed to me for the sake of her son.</p>
<p>But just as I was stepping out of the car, feeling physically
weak and slipping a little, though Father Dan and Sister Mildred
were helping me to alight, my Martin's mother rushed at me and
gathered me in her arms, crying:</p>
<p>"Goodness gracious me, doctor&mdash;if it isn't little Mary
O'Neill, God bless her!"&mdash;just as she did in the old, old days
when I came as a child "singing carvals to her door."</p>

<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_EIGHTH_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_EIGHTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>When I awoke next morning in "Mary O'Neill's little room," with
its odour of clean white linen and sweet-smelling scraas, the sun
was shining in at the half-open window, birds were singing, cattle
were lowing, young lambs were bleating, a crow was cawing its way
across the sky, and under the sounds of the land there was a
far-off murmur of the sea.</p>
<p>Through the floor (unceiled beneath) I could hear the Doctor and
Christian Ann chortling away in low tones like two cheerful old
love-birds; and when I got up and looked out I saw the pink and
white blossom of the apple and plum trees, and smelt the smoke of
burning peat from the chimney, as well as the salt of the sea-weed
from the shore.</p>
<p>Sister Mildred came to help me to dress, and when I went
downstairs to the sweet kitchen-parlour, feeling so strong and
fresh, Christian Ann, who was tossing an oat-cake she was baking on
the griddle, cried to me, as to a child:</p>
<p>"Come your ways, <i>villish</i>; you know the house."</p>
<p>And when I stepped over the rag-work hearthrug and sat in the
"elbow-chair" in the <i>chiollagh</i>, under the silver bowls that
stood on the high mantelpiece, she cried again, as if addressing
the universe in general, for there was nobody else in the room:</p>
<p>"Look at that now! She's been out in the big world, and seen
great wonders, and a power of people I'll go bail, but there she
is, as nice and comfortable as if she had never been away!"</p>
<p>Sister Mildred came down next; and then the old doctor, who had
been watching the road for Martin (he had refused to occupy the old
people's bedroom after all and had put up at the "Plough"), came
in, saying:</p>
<p>"The boy's late, mother&mdash;what's doing on him, I
wonder?"</p>
<p>We waited awhile longer, and then sat down to breakfast. Oh, the
homely beauty of that morning meal, with its porridge, its milk,
its honey and cakes, its butter like gold, and its eggs like
cream!</p>
<p>In spite of Sister Mildred's protests Christian Ann stood and
served, and I will not say that for me there was not a startling
delight in being waited upon once more, being asked what I would
like, and getting it, giving orders and being obeyed&mdash;me, me,
me!</p>
<p>At length in the exercise of my authority I insisted on
Christian Ann sitting down too, which she did, though she didn't
eat, but went on talking in her dear, simple, delicious way.</p>
<p>It was always about Martin, and the best of it was about her
beautiful faith that he was still alive when the report came that
he had been lost at sea.</p>
<p>What? Her son dying like that, and she old and the sun going
down on her? Never! Newspapers? Chut, who cared what people put in
the papers? If Martin had really been lost, wouldn't <i>she</i>
have known it&mdash;having borne him on her bosom ("a middling hard
birth, too"), and being the first to hear his living voice in the
world?</p>
<p>So while people thought she was growing "weak in her
intellects," she had clung to the belief that her beloved son would
come back to her. And behold! one dark night in winter, when she
was sitting in the <i>chiollagh</i> alone, and the wind was loud in
the trees, and the doctor upstairs was calling on her to come to
bed ("you're wearing yourself away, woman"), she heard a sneck of
the garden gate and a step on the gravel path, and it was old Tommy
the Mate, who without waiting for her to open the door let a great
yell out of him through the window that a "talegraf" had come to
say her boy was safe.</p>
<p>Father Dan looked in after mass, in his biretta and faded
cassock (the same, I do declare, that he had worn when I was a
child), and then Martin himself came swinging up, with his big
voice, like a shout from the quarter-deck.</p>
<p>"Helloa! Stunning morning, isn't it?"</p>
<p>It was perfectly delightful to see the way he treated his
mother, though there was not too much reverence in his teasing, and
hardly more love than license.</p>
<p>When she told him to sit down if he had not forgotten the house,
and said she hoped he had finished looking for South Poles and was
ready to settle quietly at home, and he answered No, he would have
to go back to London presently, she cried:</p>
<p>"There now, doctor? What was I telling you? Once they've been
away, it's witched they are&mdash;longing and longing to go back
again. What's there in London that's wanting him?"</p>
<p>Whereupon the doctor (thinking of the knighthood), with a proud
lift of his old head and a wink at Father Dan, said:</p>
<p>"Who knows? Perhaps it's the King that's wanting him,
woman."</p>
<p>"The King?" cried Christian Ann. "He's got a bonny son of his
own, they're telling me, so what for should he be wanting
mine?"</p>
<p>"Mary," said. Martin, as soon as he could speak for laughing,
"do you want a mother? I've got one to sell, and I wouldn't trust
but I might give her away."</p>
<p>"Cuff him, Mrs. Conrad," cried Father Dan. "Cuff him, the young
rascal! He may be a big man in the great world over the water, but
he mustn't come here expecting his mother and his old priest to
worship him."</p>
<p>How we laughed! I laughed until I cried, not knowing which I was
doing most, but feeling as if I had never had an ache or a care in
all my life before.</p>
<p>Breakfast being over, the men going into the garden to smoke,
and Sister Mildred insisting on clearing the table, Christian Ann
took up her knitting, sat by my side, and told me the "newses" of
home&mdash;sad news, most of it, about my father, God pity him, and
how his great schemes for "galvanising the old island into life"
had gone down to failure and fatuity, sending some to the asylum
and some to the graveyard, and certain of the managers of
corporations and banks to gaol.</p>
<p>My father himself had escaped prosecution; but he was supposed
to be a ruined man, dying of cancer, and had gone to live in his
mother's old cottage on the curragh, with only Nessy MacLeod to
care for him&mdash;having left the Big House to Aunt Bridget and
cousin Betsy, who declared (so I gathered or guessed) that I had
disgraced their name and should never look on their faces
again.</p>
<p>"But dear heart alive, that won't cut much ice, will it?" said
Christian Ann, catching a word of Martin's.</p>
<p>Later in the day, being alone with the old doctor. I heard
something of my husband also&mdash;that he had applied (according
to the laws of Ellan) for an Act of Divorce, and that our insular
legislature was likely to grant it.</p>
<p>Still later, having walked out into the garden, where the
bluebells were in bloom, I, too, heard the sneck of the gate, and
it was old Tommy again, who (having been up to the "Plough" to "put
a sight on himself") had come round to welcome me as well&mdash;a
little older, a little feebler, "tacking a bit," as he said, with
"romps in his fetlock joints," but feeling "well tremenjus."</p>
<p>He had brought the "full of his coat-pockets" of lobsters and
crabs for me ("wonderful good for invalids, missie") and the "full
of his mouth" of the doings at Castle Raa, which he had left
immediately after myself&mdash;Price also, neither of them being
willing to stay with a master who had "the rough word" for
everybody, and a "misthress" who had "the black curse on her" that
would "carry her naked sowl to hell."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't be gardener there, after the lil missie had gone . .
. no, not for the Bank of Ellan and it full of goold."</p>
<p>What a happy, happy day that was! There was many another day
like it, too, during the sweet time following, when spring was
smiling once more upon earth and man, and body and soul in myself
were undergoing a resurrection no less marvellous.</p>
<p>After three or four weeks I had so far recovered as to be able
to take walks with Martin&mdash;through the leafy lanes with the
golden gorse on the high turf hedges and its nutty odour in the
air, as far, sometimes, as to the shore, where we talked about
"asploring" or perhaps (without speaking at all) looked into each
other's eyes and laughed.</p>
<p>There was really only one limitation to my happiness, separation
from my child, and though I was conscious of something anomalous in
my own position which the presence of my baby would make acute
(setting all the evil tongues awag), I could not help it if, as I
grew stronger, I yearned for my little treasure.</p>
<p>The end of it was that, after many timid efforts, I took courage
and asked Martin if I might have my precious darling back.</p>
<p>"Girlie?" he cried. "Certainly you may. You are well enough now,
so why shouldn't you? I'm going to London on Exploration business
soon, and I'll bring her home with me."</p>
<p>But when he was gone (Mildred went with him) I was still
confronted by one cause of anxiety&mdash;Christian Ann. I could not
even be sure she knew of the existence of my child, still less that
Martin intended to fetch her.</p>
<p>So once more I took my heart in both hands, and while we sat
together in the garden, with the sunlight pouring through the
trees, Christian Ann knitting and I pretending to read, I told her
all.</p>
<p>She knew everything already, the dear old thing, and had only
been waiting for me to speak. After dropping a good many stitches
she said:</p>
<p>"The world will talk, and dear heart knows what Father Dan
himself will say. But blood's thicker than water even if it's holy
water, and she's my own child's child, God bless her!"</p>
<p>After that we had such delicious times together, preparing for
the little stranger who was to come&mdash;cutting up blankets and
sheets, and smuggling down from the "loft" to "Mary O'Neill's room"
the wooden cradle which had once been Martin's, and covering it
with bows and ribbons.</p>
<p>We kept the old doctor in the dark (pretended we did) and when
he wondered "what all the fuss was about," and if "the island
expected a visit from the Queen," we told him (Christian Ann did)
to "ask us no questions and we'd tell no lies."</p>
<p>What children we were, we two mothers, the old one and the young
one! I used to hint, with an air of great mystery, that my baby had
"somebody's eyes," and then the dear simple old thing would
say:</p>
<p>"Somebody's eyes, has she? Well, well! Think of that, now!"</p>
<p>But Christian Ann, from the lofty eminence of the motherhood of
one child twenty-five years before, was my general guide and
counsellor, answering all my foolish questions when I counted up
baby's age (eleven months now) and wondered if she could walk and
talk by this time, how many of her little teeth should have come
and whether she could remember me.</p>
<p>As the time approached for Martin's return our childishness
increased, and on the last day of all we carried on such a game
together as must have made the very Saints themselves look down on
us and laugh.</p>
<p>Before I opened my eyes in the morning I was saying to myself,
"Now they're on their way to Euston," and every time I heard the
clock strike I was thinking, "Now they're in the train," or "Now
they're at Liverpool," or "Now they're on the steamer"; but all the
while I sang "Sally" and other nonsense, and pretended to be as
happy as the day was long.</p>
<p>Christian Ann was even more excited than myself; and though she
was always reproving me for my nervousness and telling me to be
composed, I saw her put the kettle instead of the tea-pot on to the
tablecloth, and the porridge-stick into the fire in place of the
tongs.</p>
<p>Towards evening, when Martin was due, I had reduced myself to
such a state of weakness that Christian Ann wanted to put me to
bed; but sitting down in the <i>chiollagh</i>, and watching the
road from the imprisonment of the "elbow-chair," I saw at last the
two big white eyes of the automobile wheeling round in the dusk by
the gate of my father's house.</p>
<p>A few minutes afterwards Martin came sweeping into the kitchen
with a nice-looking nurse behind him, carrying my darling at her
breast.</p>
<p>She was asleep, but the light of the fire soon wakened her, and
then a strange thing happened.</p>
<p>I had risen from my seat, and Christian Ann had come hurrying
up, and we two women were standing about baby, both ready to clutch
at her, when she blinked her blue eyes and looked at us, and then
held out her arms to her grandmother!</p>
<p>That nearly broke my heart for a moment (though now I thank the
Lord for it), but it raised Christian Ann into the seventh heaven
of rapture.</p>
<p>"Did you see that now?" she cried, clasping my baby to her
bosom&mdash;her eyes glistening as with sunshine, though her cheeks
were slushed as with rain.</p>
<p>I got my treasure to myself at last (Christian Ann having to
show the nurse up to her bedroom), and then, being alone with
Martin, I did not care, in the intoxication of my happiness, how
silly I was in my praise of her.</p>
<p>"Isn't she a little fairy, a little angel, a little cherub?" I
cried. "And that nasty, nasty birthmark quite, quite gone."</p>
<p>The ugly word had slipped out unawares, but Martin had caught
it, and though I tried to make light of it, he gave me no peace
until I had told him what it meant&mdash;with all the humiliating
story of my last night at Castle Raa and the blow my husband had
struck me.</p>
<p>"But that's all over now," I said.</p>
<p>"Is it? By the Lord God I swear it isn't, though!" said Martin,
and his face was so fierce that it made me afraid.</p>
<p>But just at that moment Christian Ann came downstairs, and the
old doctor returned from his rounds, and then Tommy the Mate looked
in on his way to the "Plough," and hinting at my going to church
again some day, gave it as his opinion that if I put the "boght
mulish" under my "perricut" (our old island custom for legitimising
children) "the Bishop himself couldn't say nothin' against it"-at
which Martin laughed so much that I thought he had forgotten his
vow about my husband.</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM OF MARTIN CONRAD</p>
<p>I hadn't, though.</p>
<p>The brute! The bully! When my darling told me that story (I had
to drag it out of her) I felt that if I had been within a hundred
miles at the time, and had had to crawl home to the man on my hands
and knees, there wouldn't have been enough of him left now to throw
on the dust-heap.</p>
<p>Nearly two years had passed since the debt was incurred, but I
thought a Christian world could not go on a day longer until I had
paid it back&mdash;with interest.</p>
<p>So fearing that my tender-hearted little woman, if she got wind
of my purpose, might make me promise to put away my vow of
vengeance, I got up early next morning and ordered the motor-car to
be made ready for a visit to Castle Raa.</p>
<p>Old Tommy happened to be in the yard of the inn while I was
speaking to the chauffeur, and he asked if he might be allowed to
go with me. I agreed, and when I came out to start he was sitting
in a corner of the car, with his Glengarry pulled down over his
shaggy eyebrows, and his knotty hands leaning on a thick blackthorn
that had a head as big as a turnip.</p>
<p>We did not talk too much on the way&mdash;I had to save up my
strength for better business&mdash;and it was a long spin, but we
got to our journey's end towards the middle of the morning.</p>
<p>As we went up the drive (sacred to me by one poignant memory) an
open carriage was coming down. The only occupant was a rather
vulgar-looking elderly woman (in large feathers and flowing
furbelows) whom I took to be the mother of Alma.</p>
<p>Three powdered footmen came to the door of the Castle as our car
drove up. Their master was out riding. They did not know when he
would be back.</p>
<p>"I'll wait for him," I said, and pushed into the hall, old Tommy
following me.</p>
<p>I think the footmen had a mind to intercept us, but I suppose
there was something in my face which told them it would be better
not to try, so I walked into the first room with the door open.</p>
<p>It turned out to be the dining-room, with portraits of the
owner's ancestors all round the walls&mdash;a solid square of
evil-looking rascals, every mother's son of them.</p>
<p>Tommy, still resting his knotty hands on his big blackthorn, was
sitting on the first chair by the door, and I on the end of the
table, neither saying a word to the other, when there came the
sound of horses' hoofs on the path outside. A little later there
were voices in the hall, both low and loud ones&mdash;the footmen
evidently announcing my arrival and their master abusing them for
letting me into the house.</p>
<p>At the next moment the man came sweeping into the dining-room.
He was carrying a heavy hunting-crop and his flabby face was livid.
Behind him came Alma. She was in riding costume and was bending a
lithe whip in her gloved hands.</p>
<p>I saw that my noble lord was furious, but that mood suited me as
well as another, so I continued to sit on the end of the table.</p>
<p>"So I hear, sir," he said, striding up to me, "I hear that you
have taken possession of my place without so much as 'by your
leave'?"</p>
<p>"That's so," I answered.</p>
<p>"Haven't you done enough mischief here, without coming to insult
me by your presence?"</p>
<p>"Not quite. I've a little more to do before I've finished."</p>
<p>"Jim," said the woman (in such a weary voice), "don't put
yourself about over such a person. Better ring the bell for the
servants and have him turned out of doors."</p>
<p>I looked round at her. She tried an insolent smile, but it broke
down badly, and then his lordship strode up to me with quivering
lips.</p>
<p>"Look here, sir," he said. "Aren't you ashamed to show your face
in my house?"</p>
<p>"I'm not," I replied. "But before I leave it, I believe
<i>you'll</i> be ashamed to show your face anywhere."</p>
<p>"Damn it, sir! Will you do me the honour to tell me why you are
here?" said his lordship, with fury in his looks.</p>
<p>"Certainly. That's exactly what I've come for," I said, and then
I stated my business without more ado.</p>
<p>I told him what he had done to the woman who was ten thousand
times too good to be his wife-torturing her with his cruelties,
degrading her with his infidelities, subjecting her to the
domination of his paramour, and finally striking her in the face
like a coward and a cur.</p>
<p>"Liar!" he cried, fairly gasping in his rage. "You're a liar and
your informant is a liar, too."</p>
<p>"Tommy," I said, "will you step outside for a moment?"</p>
<p>Tommy went out of the room at once, and the woman, who was now
looking frightened, tried to follow him.</p>
<p>I stopped her. Rising from the table, I stepped over to the door
and locked it.</p>
<p>"No, madam," I said. "I want you to see what takes place between
his lordship and me."</p>
<p>The wretched woman fell back, but the man, grinding his teeth,
came marching up to me.</p>
<p>"So you've come to fight me in my own house, have you?" he
cried.</p>
<p>"Not at all," I answered. "A man fights his equal. I've come to
<i>thrash you</i>."</p>
<p>That was enough for him, he lifted his hunting-crop to strike,
but it didn't take long to get that from his hand or to paralyse
the arm with which he was lunging out at me.</p>
<p>And then, seizing him by the white stock at his throat, I
thrashed him. I thrashed him as I should have thrashed vicious ape.
I thrashed him while he fumed and foamed, and cursed and swore. I
thrashed him while he cried for help, and then yelled with pain and
whined for mercy. I thrashed him under the eyes of his ancestors,
the mad, bad race he came from, and, him the biggest blackguard of
them all. And then I flung him to the ground, bruised in every
bone, and his hunting-crop after him.</p>
<p>"I hear you're going to court for an Act of Divorce," I said.
"Pity you can't take something to back you, so take that, and say I
gave it you."</p>
<p>I was turning towards the door when I heard a low, whining cry,
like that of a captured she-bear. It was from the woman. The
wretched creature was on her knees at the farthest corner of the
room, apparently mumbling prayers, as if in terror that her own
turn might be coming next.</p>
<p>In her sobbing fear I thought she looked more than ever like a
poisonous snake, and I will not say that the old impulse to put my
foot on it did not come back for a moment. But I only said as I
passed, pointing to the writhing worm on the floor:</p>
<p>"Look at him, madame. I wish you joy of your nobleman, and him
of you."</p>
<p>Then I opened the door, and notwithstanding the grim business I
had been going through, I could have laughed at the scene
outside.</p>
<p>There was old Tommy with his back to the dining-room door, his
Glengarry awry on his tousled head, and his bandy legs stretched
firmly apart, flourishing his big-headed blackthorn before the
faces of the three powdered footmen, and inviting them to "come
on."</p>
<p>"Come on, now, you bleating ould billy-goats, come on, come
on!"</p>
<p>I was in no hurry to get away, but lit a cigar in front of the
house while the chauffeur was starting the motor and Tommy was
wiping his steaming forehead on the sleeve of his coat.</p>
<p>All the way home the old man talked without ceasing, sometimes
to me, and sometimes to the world in general.</p>
<p>"You gave him a piece of your mind, didn't you?" he asked, with
a wink of his "starboard eye."</p>
<p>"I believe I did," I answered.</p>
<p>"I allus said you would. 'Wait till himself is after coming
home, and it'll be the devil sit up for some of them,' says I."</p>
<p>There was only one limitation to Tommy's satisfaction over our
day's expedition&mdash;that he had not cracked the powdered skulls
of "some o' them riddiclus dunkeys."</p>
<p>[END OF MARTIN CONRAD'S MEMORANDUM]</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_NINTH_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_NINTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND NINTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>Another month passed, and then began the last and most important
phase of my too changeful story.</p>
<p>Every week Martin had been coming and going between Ellan and
London, occupied when he was away with the business of his next
Expedition (for which Parliament had voted a large sum), and when
he was at home with reports, diaries, charts, maps, and photographs
toward a book he was writing about his last one.</p>
<p>As for myself, I had been (or tried to think I had been)
entirely happy. With fresh air, new milk, a sweet bedroom, and
above all, good and tender nursing (God bless Christian Ann for all
she did for me!), my health had improved every day&mdash;or
perhaps, by that heavenly hopefulness which goes with certain
maladies, it had seemed to me to do so.</p>
<p>Yet mine was a sort of twilight happiness, nevertheless. Though
the sun was always shining in my sky, it was frequently under
eclipse. In spite of the sheltered life I lived in that home of
charity and love, I was never entirely free from a certain
indefinable uneasiness about my position.</p>
<p>I was always conscious, too, that Martin's mother and father,
not to speak of Father Dan, were suffering from a similar feeling,
for sometimes when we talked about the future their looks would
answer to my thoughts, and it was just as if we were all silently
waiting, waiting, waiting for some event that was to justify and
rehabilitate me.</p>
<p>It came at last&mdash;for me with a startling suddenness.</p>
<p>One morning, nurse being out on an errand and Christian Ann
patting her butter in the dairy, I was playing with baby on the
rag-work hearthrug when our village newsman came to the threshold
of the open door.</p>
<p>"Take a <i>Times</i>," he said. "You might as well be out of the
world, ma'am, as not know what's going on in it."</p>
<p>I took one of his island newspapers, and after he had gone I
casually glanced at it.</p>
<p>But what a shock it gave me! The first heading that flew in my
face was&mdash;</p>
<p>"INSULAR DIVORCE BILL PASSED."</p>
<p>It was a report of the proceedings of the Supreme Court of our
Ellan legislature, which (notwithstanding the opposition of its
ecclesiastical members) had granted my husband's petition.</p>
<p>Perhaps I ought to have had a sense of immense relief. Or
perhaps I should have gone down on my knees there and then, and
thanked God that the miserable entanglement of the horrible
marriage that had been forced upon me was at last at an end.</p>
<p>But no, I had only one feeling as the newspaper fell from my
fingers&mdash;shame and humiliation, not for myself (for what did
it matter about me, anyway?), but for Martin, whose name, now so
famous, I had, through my husband's malice, been the means of
dragging through the dust.</p>
<p>I remember that I thought I should never be able to look into my
darling's face again, that when he came in the afternoon (as he
always did) I should have to run away from him, and that all that
was left to me was to hide myself and die.</p>
<p>But just as these wild thoughts were galloping through my brain
I heard the sneck of the garden gate, and almost before I was aware
of what else was happening Martin had come sweeping into the house
like a rush of wind, thrown his arms around me, and covered my
face, my neck, and my hands with kisses&mdash;never having done so
before since I came to live at his mother's home.</p>
<p>"Such news! Such news!" he cried. "We are free, free, free!"</p>
<p>Then, seeing the newspaper at my feet on the floor, he said:</p>
<p>"Ah, I see you know already. I told them to keep everything away
from you&mdash;all the miserable legal business. But no matter!
It's over now. Of course it's shocking&mdash;perfectly
shocking&mdash;that that squirming worm, after his gross
infidelities, should have been able to do what he has done. But
what matter about that either? He has done just what we
wanted&mdash;what you couldn't do for yourself before I went away,
your conscience forbidding you. The barrier that has divided us is
down . . . now we can be married at any time."</p>
<p>I was so overcome by Martin's splendid courage, so afraid to
believe fully that the boundless relief I had looked for so long
had come to me at last, that for some time I could not speak. And
when I did speak, though my heart was clamouring loud, I only
said:</p>
<p>"But do you really think that . . . that we can now be husband
and wife?"</p>
<p>"Think it?" he cried, with a peal of laughter. "I should think I
do think it. What's to prevent us? Nothing! You've suffered enough,
my poor girl. But all that you have gone through has to be
forgotten, and you are never to look back again."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I know I should be happy, very happy," I said, "but
what about you?"</p>
<p>"Me?"</p>
<p>"I looked forward to being a help&mdash;at least not a trouble
to you, Martin."</p>
<p>"And so you will be. Why shouldn't you?"</p>
<p>"Martin," I said (I knew what I was doing, but I couldn't help
doing it), "wouldn't it injure you to marry me . . . being what I
am now . . . in the eyes of the world, I mean?"</p>
<p>He looked at me for a moment as if trying to catch my meaning,
and then snatched me still closer to his breast.</p>
<p>"Mary," he cried, "don't ask me to consider what the damnable
insincerities of society may say to a case like ours. If <i>you</i>
don't care, then neither do I. And as for the world, by the Lord
God I swear that all I ask of it I am now holding in my arms."</p>
<p>That conquered me&mdash;poor trembling hypocrite that I was,
praying with all my soul that my objections would be overcome.</p>
<p>In another moment I had thrown my arms about my Martin's neck
and kissed and kissed him, feeling for the first time after my
months and years of fiery struggle that in the eyes of God and man
I had a <i>right</i> to do so.</p>
<p>And oh dear, oh dear! When Martin had gone back to his work,
what foolish rein I gave to my new-born rapture!</p>
<p>I picked baby up from the hearthrug and kissed her also, and
then took her into the dairy to be kissed by her grandmother, who
must have overheard what had passed between Martin and me, for I
noticed that her voice had suddenly become livelier and at least an
octave higher.</p>
<p>Then, baby being sleepy, I took her upstairs for her morning
nap, and after leaning over her cradle, in the soft, damp,
milk-like odour of her sweet body and breath, I stood up before the
glass and looked at my own hot, tingling, blushing cheeks and
sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>Oh, what gorgeous dreams of happiness came to me! I may have
been the unmarried mother of a child, but my girlhood&mdash;my lost
girlhood&mdash;was flowing back upon me. A vision of my
marriage-day rose up before me and I saw myself as a bride, in my
bridal veil and blossoms.</p>
<p>How happy I was going to be! But indeed I felt just then as if I
had always been happy. It was almost as though some blessed stream
of holy water had washed my memory clean of all the soilure of my
recent days in London, for sure I am that if anybody had at that
moment mentioned Ilford and the East End, the bricklayer and the
Jew, or spoken of the maternity homes and the orphanages, I should
have screamed.</p>
<p>Towards noon the old doctor came back from his morning rounds,
and I noticed that <i>his</i> voice was pitched higher too. We
never once spoke about the great news, the great event, while we
sat at table; but I could not help noticing that we were all
talking loud and fast and on the top of each other, as if some dark
cloud which had hovered over our household had suddenly slid
away.</p>
<p>After luncheon, nurse being back with baby, I went out for a
walk alone, feeling wonderfully well and light, and having two
hours to wait for Martin, who must be still pondering over his
papers at the "Plough."</p>
<p>How beautiful was the day! How blue the sky! How bright the
earth! How joyous the air&mdash;so sweet and so full of
song-birds!</p>
<p>I remember that I thought life had been so good to me that I
ought to be good to everybody else&mdash;especially to my father,
from whom it seemed wrong for a daughter to be estranged, whatever
he was and whatever he had done to her.</p>
<p>So I turned my face towards my poor grandmother's restored
cottage on the curragh, fully determined to be reconciled to my
father; and I only slackened my steps and gave up my purpose when I
began to think of Nessy MacLeod and how difficult (perhaps
impossible) it might be to reach him.</p>
<p>Even then I faced about for a moment to the Big House with some
vain idea of making peace with Aunt Bridget and then slipping
upstairs to my mother's room&mdash;having such a sense of joyous
purity that I wished to breathe the sacred air my blessed saint had
lived in.</p>
<p>But the end of it all was that I found myself on the steps of
the Presbytery, feeling breathlessly happy, and telling myself,
with a little access of pride in my own gratitude, that it was only
right and proper that I should bring my happiness where I had so
often brought my sorrow&mdash;to the dear priest who had been my
friend since the day of my birth and my darling mother's friend
before.</p>
<p>Poor old Father Dan! How good I was going to be to him!</p>

"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_TENTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND TENTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>A few minutes afterwards I was tripping upstairs (love and hope
work wonderful miracles!) behind the Father's Irish housekeeper,
Mrs. Cassidy, who was telling me how well I was looking ("smart and
well extraordinary"), asking if it "was on my two feet I had walked
all the way," and denouncing the "omathauns" who had been "after
telling her there wasn't the width of a wall itself betune me and
the churchyard."</p>
<p>I found Father Dan in his cosy study lined with books; and being
so much wrapped up in my own impetuous happiness I did not see at
first that he was confused and nervous, or remember until next day
that, though (at the sound of my voice from the landing) he cried
"Come in, my child, come in," he was standing with his back to the
door as I entered&mdash;hiding something (it must have been a
newspaper) under the loose seat of his easy-chair.</p>
<p>"Father," I said, "have you heard the news?"</p>
<p>"The news. . . ."</p>
<p>"I mean the news in the newspaper."</p>
<p>"Ah, the news in the newspaper."</p>
<p>"Isn't it glorious? That terrible marriage is over at last!
Without my doing anything, either! Do you remember what you said
the last time I came here?"</p>
<p>"The last time. . . ."</p>
<p>"You said that I, being a Catholic, could not break my marriage
without breaking my faith. But my husband, being a Protestant, had
no compunction. So it has come to the same thing in the end, you
see. And now I'm free."</p>
<p>"You're free . . . free, are you?"</p>
<p>"It seems they have been keeping it all away from
me&mdash;making no defence, I suppose&mdash;and it was only this
morning I heard the news."</p>
<p>"Only this morning, was it?"</p>
<p>"I first saw it in a newspaper, but afterwards Martin himself
came to tell me."</p>
<p>"Martin came, did he?"</p>
<p>"He doesn't care in the least; in fact, he is glad, and says we
can be married at any time."</p>
<p>"Married at any time&mdash;he says that, does he?"</p>
<p>"Of course nothing is arranged yet, dear Father, but I couldn't
help coming to see you about it. I want everything to be simple and
quiet&mdash;no display of any kind."</p>
<p>"Simple and quiet, do you?"</p>
<p>"Early in the morning&mdash;immediately after mass,
perhaps."</p>
<p>"Immediately after mass. . . ."</p>
<p>"Only a few wild flowers on the altar, and the dear homely souls
who love me gathered around."</p>
<p>"The dear, homely souls. . . ."</p>
<p>"It will be a great, great thing for me, but I don't want to
force myself upon anybody, or to triumph over any one&mdash;least
of all over my poor father, now that he is so sick and down."</p>
<p>"No, no . . . now that he is so sick and down."</p>
<p>"I shall want you to marry us, Daddy Dan&mdash;not the Bishop or
anybody else of that kind, you know."</p>
<p>"You'll want me to marry you&mdash;not the Bishop or anybody
else of that kind."</p>
<p>"But Father Dan," I cried, laughing a little uneasily (for I had
begun to realise that he was only repeating my own words), "why
don't you say something for yourself?"</p>
<p>And then the cheery sunshine of the cosy room began to fade
away.</p>
<p>Father Dan fumbled the silver cross which hung over his cassock
(a sure sign of his nervousness), and said with a grave face and in
a voice all a-tremble with emotion:</p>
<p>"My child. . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"You believe that I wouldn't pain or distress or shock you if I
could avoid it?"</p>
<p>"Indeed I do."</p>
<p>"Yet I am going to pain and distress and shock you now. I . . .
I cannot marry you to Martin Conrad. I daren't. The Church thinks
that you are married already&mdash;that you are still the wife of
your husband."</p>
<p>Though my dear priest had dealt me my death-blow, I had not yet
begun to feel it, so I smiled up into his troubled old face and
said:</p>
<p>"But how can the Church think that, dear Father? My husband has
no rights over me now, and no duties or responsibilities with
respect to me. He can marry again if he likes. And he will, I am
sure he will, and nobody can prevent him. How, then, can the Church
say that I am still his wife?"</p>
<p>"Because marriage, according to the law of the Church, can only
be dissolved by death," said Father Dan. "Haven't I told you that
before, my daughter? Didn't we go over it again and again when you
were here the last time?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, but I thought if somebody else sought the
divorce&mdash;somebody who had never believed in the
indissolubility of marriage and wasn't bound by the law of the
Church . . . we've heard of cases of that kind, haven't we?"</p>
<p>Father Dan shook his head.</p>
<p>"My poor child, no. The Church thinks marriage is a sacred
covenant which no difference of belief, no sin on either side, can
ever break."</p>
<p>"But, Father," I cried, "don't you see that the law has already
broken it?"</p>
<p>"Only the civil law, my daughter. Remember the words of our
blessed and holy Redeemer: '<i>Every one that putteth away his wife
and marrieth another committeth adultery; and he that marrieth one
that is put away committeth adultery.'</i> . . . My poor child, my
heart bleeds for you, but isn't that the Divine Commandment?"</p>
<p>"Then you think," I said (the room was becoming dark and I could
feel my lip trembling), "you think that because I went through that
marriage ceremony two years ago . . . and though the civil law has
dissolved it . . . you think I am still bound by it, and will
continue to be so . . . to the end of my life?"</p>
<p>Father Dan plucked at his cassock, fumbled his print
handkerchief, and replied:</p>
<p>"I am sorry, my child, very, very sorry."</p>
<p>"Father Dan," I said sharply, for by this time my heart was
beginning to blaze, "have you thought about Martin? Aren't you
afraid that if our Church refuses to marry us he may ask some other
church to do so?"</p>
<p>"Christ's words must be the final law for all true Christians,
my daughter. And besides. . . ."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"Besides that. . . ."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"It blisters my tongue to say it, my child, knowing your
sufferings and great temptations, but. . . ."</p>
<p>"But what, dear Father?"</p>
<p>"You are in the position of the guilty party, and therefore no
good clergyman of any Christian Church in the world, following the
Commandment of his Master, would dare to marry you."</p>
<p>What happened after that I cannot exactly say. I remember that,
feeling the colour flying to my face, I flung up my hands to cover
it, and that when I came to full possession of my senses again
Father Dan (himself in a state of great agitation) was smoothing my
arms and comforting me.</p>
<p>"Don't be angry with your old priest for telling you the
truth&mdash;the bitter truth, my daughter."</p>
<p>He had always seen this dark hour coming to him, and again and
again he had prayed to be delivered from it&mdash;in the long
nights of his fruitless wanderings when I was lost in London, and
again since I had been found and had come home and he had looked
on, with many a pang, at our silent hopes and
expectations&mdash;Martin's and mine, we two children.</p>
<p>"And when you came into my little den to-day, my daughter, with
a face as bright as stars and diamonds, God knows I would have
given half of what is left of my life that mine should not be the
hand to dash the cup of your happiness away."</p>
<p>As soon as I was sufficiently composed, within and without,
Father Dan led me downstairs (praying God and His Holy Mother to
strengthen me on my solitary way), and then stood at the door in
his cassock to watch me while I walked up the road.</p>
<p>It was hardly more than half an hour since I had passed over the
ground before, yet in that short time the world seemed to have
become pale and grey&mdash;the sun gone out, the earth grown dark,
the still air joyless, nothing left but the everlasting heavens and
the heavy song of the sea.</p>
<p>As I approached the doctor's house Martin came swinging down the
road to meet me, with his strong free step and that suggestion of
the wind from the mountain-tops which seemed to be always about
him.</p>
<p>"Hello!" he cried. "Thought you were lost and been hunting all
over the place for you."</p>
<p>But as he came nearer and saw how white and wan my face was,
though I was doing my best to smile, he stopped and said:</p>
<p>"My poor little woman, where have you been, and what have they
been doing to you?"</p>
<p>And then, as well as I could, I told him.</p>

<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_ELEVENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_ELEVENTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND ELEVENTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>"It's all my fault," he said.</p>
<p>He had led me to the garden-house, which stood among the
bluebells at the end of the orchard, and was striding to and fro in
front of it.</p>
<p>"I knew perfectly what the attitude of the Church would be, and
I ought to have warned you."</p>
<p>I had never before seen him so excited. There was a wild look in
his eyes and his voice was quivering like the string of a bow.</p>
<p>"Poor old Father Dan! He's an old angel, with as good a heart as
ever beat under a cassock. But what a slave a man may be to the
fetish of his faith! Only think what he says, my darling! The
guilty party! I'll never believe you are the guilty party, but
consider! The guilty party may never marry! No good clergyman of
any Christian Church in the world dare marry her! What an infamy!
Ask yourself what the churches are here for. Aren't they here to
bring salvation to the worst of sinners? Yet they cast out the
woman who has sinned against her marriage vow&mdash;denying her
access to the altar and turning her out of doors&mdash;though she
may have repented a thousand times, with bitter, bitter tears!"</p>
<p>He walked two or three paces in front of the garden-house and
then came back to me with flaming eyes.</p>
<p>"But that's not your case, anyway," he said. "Father Dan knows
perfectly that your marriage was no marriage at all&mdash;only a
sordid bit of commercial bargaining, in which your husband gave you
his bad name for your father's unclean money. It was no marriage in
any other sense either, and might have been annulled if there had
been any common honesty in annulment. And now that it has tumbled
to wreck and ruin, as anybody might have seen it would do, you are
told that you are bound to it to the last day and hour of your
life! After all you have gone through&mdash;all you have
suffered&mdash;never to know another hour of happiness as long as
you live! While your husband, notwithstanding his brutalities and
infidelities, is free to do what he likes, to marry whom he
pleases! How stupid! How disgusting! how damnable!"</p>
<p>His passionate voice was breaking, he could scarcely control
it.</p>
<p>"Oh, I know what they'll say. It will be the old, old song,
'Whom God hath joined together.' That's what this old Church of
ours has been saying for centuries to poor women with broken
hearts. Has the Church itself got a heart to break?
No&mdash;nothing but its cast-iron laws which have been broken a
thousand times and nobody a penny the worse."</p>
<p>"But I wonder," he continued, "I wonder why these churchmen, who
would talk about the impossibility of putting asunder those whom
God has joined together, don't begin by asking themselves how and
when and where God joins them. Is it in church, when they stand
before the altar and are asked a few questions, and give a few
answers? If so, then God is responsible for some of the most
shocking transactions that ever disgraced humanity&mdash;all the
pride and vanity and deliberate concubinage that have covered
themselves in every age, and are covering themselves still, with
the cloak of marriage."</p>
<p>"But no," said Martin, "it's not in churches that God marries
people. They've got to be married before they go there, or they are
never married at all&mdash;never! They've got to be married in
their <i>hearts</i>, for that's where God joins people together,
not in churches and before priests and altars."</p>
<p>I sat listening to him with a rising and throbbing heart, and
after another moment he stepped into the garden-house, and sat
beside me.</p>
<p>"Mary," he said, in his passionate voice, "that's our case,
isn't it? God married us from the very first. There has never been
any other woman for me, and there never has been any other man for
you&mdash;isn't that so, my darling? . . . Then what are they
talking about&mdash;these churches and churchmen? It's <i>they</i>
who are the real divorcers&mdash;trying to put those asunder whom
God Himself has joined together. That's the plain sense of the
matter, isn't it?"</p>
<p>I was trembling with fear and expectation. Perhaps it was the
same with me as it had been before; perhaps I wanted (now more than
ever) to believe what Martin was saying; perhaps I did not know
enough to be able to answer him; perhaps my overpowering love and
the position I stood in compelled me to agree. But I could not help
it if it seemed to me that his clear mind&mdash;clear as a mountain
river and as swift and strong&mdash;was sweeping away all the
worn-out sophistries.</p>
<p>"Then what . . . what are we to do?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"Do? Our duty to ourselves, my darling, that's what we have to
do. If we cannot be married according to the law of the Church, we
must be married according to the law of the land. Isn't that
enough? This is our own affair, dearest, ours and nobody else's.
It's only a witness we want anyway&mdash;a witness before God and
man that we intend to be man and wife in future."</p>
<p>"But Father Dan?"</p>
<p>"Leave him to me," said Martin. "I'll tell him everything. But
come into the house now. You are catching a cold. Unless we take
care they'll kill you before they've done."</p>
<p>Next day he leaned over the back of my chair as I sat in the
<i>chiollagh</i> with baby in my lap, and said, in a low tone:</p>
<p>"I've seen Father Dan."</p>
<p>"Well?"</p>
<p>"The old angel took it badly. 'God forbid that you should do
that same, my boy,' he said, 'putting both yourself and that sweet
child of mine out of the Church for ever.' 'It's the Church that's
putting us out,' I told him. 'But God's holy law condemns it, my
son,' he said. 'God's law is love; and He has no other law,' I
answered."</p>
<p>I was relieved and yet nervous, glad and yet afraid.</p>
<p>A week passed, and then the time came for Martin to go to
Windsor for his investiture. There had been great excitement in
Sunny Lodge in preparation for this event, but being a little
unwell I had been out of the range of it.</p>
<p>At the moment of Martin's departure I was in bed, and he had
come upstairs to say good-bye to me.</p>
<p>What had been happening in the meantime I hardly knew, but I had
gathered that he thought pressure would be brought to bear on
me.</p>
<p>"Our good old Church is like a limpet on the shore," he said.
"Once it gets its suckers down it doesn't let go in a hurry. But
sit tight, little woman. Don't yield an inch while I'm away," he
whispered.</p>
<p>When he left me I reached up to see him going down the road to
the railway station. His old father was walking proudly by his
side, bare-headed as usual and still as blithe as a boy.</p>
<p>Next day I was startled by an unexpected telegram. It came from
a convent in Lancashire and was addressed to "Mary O'Neill, care of
Doctor Conrad." It ran:</p>
<p>"<i>Am making a round of visits to the houses of our Society and
would like to see you on my way to Ireland. May I cross to-morrow?

<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_TWELFTH_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_TWELFTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND TWELFTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>She arrived the following afternoon&mdash;my dear Reverend
Mother with the pale spiritual face and saint-like eyes.</p>
<p>Except that her habit was now blue and white instead of black,
she seemed hardly changed in any respect since our days at the
Sacred Heart.</p>
<p>Finding that I was in bed, she put up at the "Plough" and came
every day to nurse me.</p>
<p>I was naturally agitated at seeing her again after so many years
and such various experiences, being uncertain how much she knew of
them.</p>
<p>Remembering Martin's warning, I was also fairly certain that she
had been sent for, but my uneasiness on both heads soon wore
off.</p>
<p>Her noiseless step, her soft voice, and her sweet smile soothed
and comforted me. I began to feel afresh the influence she had
exercised over me when I was a child, and to wonder why, during my
dark time in London, I had never thought of writing to her.</p>
<p>During the first days of her visit she said nothing about
painful things&mdash;never mentioning my marriage, or what had
happened since she saw me last.</p>
<p>Her talk was generally about our old school and my old
schoolfellows, many of whom came to the convent for her "retreats,"
which were under the spiritual direction of one of the Pope's
domestic prelates.</p>
<p>Sometimes she would laugh about our Mother of the Novices who
had "become old and naggledy"; sometimes about the little fat
Maestro of the Pope's choir who had cried when I first sang the
hymn to the Virgin, ("Go on, little angel,"); and sometimes about
the two old lay sisters (now quite toothless) who still said I
might have been a "wonderful washerwoman" if I had "put my mind to
it."</p>
<p>I hate to think that my dear Reverend Mother was doing this
consciously in order to break down my defences, but the effect was
the same. Little by little, during the few days she was with me,
she bridged the space back to my happy girlhood, for insensibly I
found myself stirred by the emotions of the convent, and breathing
again the air of my beloved Rome.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the fourth day of her visit I was sitting up
by her side in front of my window, which was wide open. It was just
such a peaceful evening as our last one at Nemi. Not a leaf was
stirring; not a breath of wind in the air; the only sounds we heard
were the lowing of the cattle waiting to be milked, the soft murmur
of the sea, and the jolting of a springless cart that was coming up
from the shore, laden with sea wrack.</p>
<p>As the sun began to sink it lit blazing fires in the windows of
the village in front&mdash;especially in the window of my mother's
room, which was just visible over the tops of the apple trees in
the orchard.</p>
<p>The Reverend Mother talked of Benediction. If she were in Rome
she would be in church singing the <i>Ora pro nobis</i>.</p>
<p>"Let us sing it now. Shall we?" she said.</p>
<p>At the next moment her deep majestic contralto, accompanied by
my own thin and quavering soprano, were sending out into the silent
air the holy notes which to me are like the reverberations of
eternity:</p>
<p>"Mater purissima<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ora pro nobis.</span><br />
Mater castissima<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ora pro nobis."</span></p>
<p>When we had finished I found my hand lying in her lap. Patting
it gently she said:</p>
<p>"Mary, I am leaving you to-morrow."</p>
<p>"So soon?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I can't go without telling you why I came"&mdash;and
then her mission was revealed to me.</p>
<p>She had heard about my marriage and the ruin it had fallen to;
my disappearance from home and the circumstances of my recovery; my
husband's petition for divorce and the disclosures that had
followed it.</p>
<p>But sad and serious and even tragic as all this might be, it was
as nothing (in the eyes of the Church and of God) compared with the
awful gravity of the step I now contemplated&mdash;a second
marriage while my husband was still alive.</p>
<p>She had nothing to say against Martin. Except the facts that
concerned myself she had never heard a word to his discredit. She
could even understand those facts, though she could not condone
them. Perhaps he had seen my position (married to a cruel and
unfaithful husband) and his pity had developed into love&mdash;she
had heard of such happenings.</p>
<p>"But only think, my child, what an abyss he is driving you to!
He asks you to break your marriage vows! . . . Oh, yes, yes, I can
see what he will say&mdash;that pressure was put upon you and you
were too young to know what you were doing. That may be true, but
it isn't everything. I thought it wrong, cruelly wrong, that your
father should choose a husband for you without regard to your wish
and will. But it was you, not your father, who made your marriage
vows, and you can never get away from that&mdash;never!"</p>
<p>Those marriage vows were sacred; our blessed Saviour had said
they could never be broken, and our holy Church had taken His
Commandment for law.</p>
<p>"Think, my child, only think what would happen to the world if
every woman who has made an unhappy marriage were to do as you
think of doing. What a chaos! What an uprooting of all the sacred
ties of home and family! And how women would suffer&mdash;women and
children above all. Don't you see that, my daughter?"</p>
<p>The security of society lay in the sanctity of marriage; the
sanctity of marriage lay in its indissolubility; and its
indissolubility centred in the fact that God was a party to it.</p>
<p>"Perhaps you are told that your marriage will be your own
concern only and that God and the Church have nothing to do with
it. But if women had believed that in all ages, how different the
world would be to-day! Oh, believe me, your marriage vow is sacred,
and you cannot break it without sin&mdash;mortal sin, my
daughter."</p>
<p>The moral of all this was that I must renounce Martin Conrad,
wash my heart clean of my love of him, shun the temptation of
seeing him again, and if possible forget him altogether.</p>
<p>"It will be hard. I know it will he hard, but. . . ."</p>
<p>"It will be quite impossible," I said as well as I could, for my
very lips were trembling.</p>
<p>I had been shaken to the depths of my soul by what the Reverend
Mother said, but remembering Martin's warning I now struggled to
resist her.</p>
<p>"Two years ago, while I was living with my husband I tried to do
that and I couldn't," I said. "And if I couldn't do it then, when
the legal barrier stood between us, how can I do it now when the
barrier is gone?"</p>
<p>After that I told her of all I had passed through since as a
result of my love for Martin&mdash;how I had parted from him when
he went down to the Antarctic; how I had waited for him in London;
how I had sacrificed family and friends and home, and taken up
poverty and loneliness and hard work for him; how I had fallen into
fathomless depths of despair when I thought I had lost him; and how
joy and happiness had returned only when God, in His gracious
goodness, had given him back.</p>
<p>"No, no, no", I cried. "My love for Martin can never be overcome
or forgotten&mdash;never as long as I live in the world!"</p>
<p>"Then," said the Reverend Mother (she had been listening
intently with her great eyes fixed on my hot and tingling face),
"then," she said, in her grave and solemn voice, "If that is the
case, my child, there is only one thing for you to do&mdash;to
leave it."</p>
<p>"Leave it?"</p>
<p>"Leave the world, I mean. Return with me to Rome and enter the
convent."</p>
<p>It would be impossible to say how this affected me&mdash;how it
shook me to the heart's core&mdash;how, in spite of my efforts to
act on my darling's warning, it seemed to penetrate to the inmost
part of my being and to waken some slumbering instinct in my
soul.</p>
<p>For a long time I sat without speaking again, only listening
with a fluttering heart to what the Reverend Mother was
saying&mdash;that it was one of the objects of the religious life
to offer refuge to the tortured soul that could not trust itself to
resist temptation; and that taking my vows as a nun to God would be
the only way (known to and acknowledged by the Church) of
cancelling my vows as a wife to my husband.</p>
<p>"You will be a bride still, my child, but a bride of Christ. And
isn't that better&mdash;far better? You used to wish to be a nun,
you know, and if your father had not come for you on that most
unhappy errand you might have been one of ourselves already. Think
of it, my child. The Mothers of our convent will be glad to welcome
you, if you can come as a willing and contented Sister. And how can
I leave you here, at the peril of your soul, my daughter?"</p>
<p>I was deeply moved, but I made one more effort.</p>
<p>I told the Reverend Mother that, since the days when I had
wished to be a nun, a great change had come over me. I had become a
woman, with all a woman's passions&mdash;the hunger and thirst for
love, human love, the love of the good man who loved me with all
his soul and strength. Therefore I could never be a willing and
contented Sister. I should only break the peace and harmony of
their house. And though she were to put me down in the lowest cell
of her convent, my love would follow me there; it would interrupt
my offices, it would clamour through my prayers, and I should
always be unhappy&mdash;miserably unhappy.</p>
<p>"Not so unhappy there as you will be if you remain in the world
and carry out your intention," said the Reverend Mother. "Oh
believe me, my child, I know you better than you know yourself. If
you marry again, you will never be able to forget that you have
broken your vow. Other women may forget it&mdash;frivolous
women&mdash;women living in society and devoting their lives to
selfish pleasures. Such women may divorce their husbands, or be
divorced by them, and then marry again, without remembering that
they are living in a state of sin, whatever the civil law may
say&mdash;open and wicked and shameless sin. But you will remember
it, and it will make you more unhappy than you have ever been in
your life before."</p>
<p>"Worse than that," she continued, after a moment, "it will make
your husband unhappy also. He will see your remorse, and share it,
because he will know he has been the cause. If he is a good man the
mere sight of your grief will torture him. The better man he is the
more will he suffer. If you were a runaway nun he would wish to
take you back to your convent, for though it might tear his heart
out to part with you, he would want to restore your soul. But being
a wife who has broken her marriage vows he will never be able to do
anything. An immense and awful shadow will stand between you and
darken every hour of your lives that is left."</p>
<p>When the Reverend Mother had done I sat motionless and
speechless, with an aching and suffocating heart, staring down on
the garden over which the night was falling.</p>
<p>After a while she patted my cold hand and got up to go, saying
she would call early in the morning to bid me good-bye. Her visit
to Ireland would not last longer than three weeks, and after that
she might come back for me, if I felt on reflection (she was sure I
should) that I ought to return with her to Rome.</p>
<p>I did not reply. Perhaps it was partly because I was physically
weak that my darling's warning was so nearly overcome. But the
moment the door closed on the Reverend Mother a conviction of the
truth of what she had said rushed upon me like the waves of an
overflowing sea.</p>
<p>Yet how cruel! After all our waiting, all our longing, all our
gorgeous day-dreams of future happiness! When I was going to be a
bride, a happy bride, with my lost and stolen girlhood coming back
to me!</p>
<p>For the second time a dark and frowning mountain had risen
between Martin and me. Formerly it had been my marriage&mdash;now
it was my God.</p>
<p>But if God forbade my marriage with Martin what was I to do?
What was left in life for me? Was there anything left?</p>
<p>I was sitting with both hands over my face, asking myself these
questions and struggling with a rising tempest of tears, when I
heard baby crying in the room below, and Christian Ann hushing and
comforting her.</p>
<p>"What's doing on the <i>boght</i>, I wonder?"</p>
<p>A few minutes later they came upstairs, Isabel on her
grandmother's arm, in her nightdress, ready for bed.</p>
<p>"If it isn't the wind I don't know in the world what's doing on
the <i>millish</i>," said the old lady.</p>
<p>And then baby smiled through the big round beads that stood in
her sea-blue eyes and held out her arms to me.</p>
<p>Oh God! Oh God! Was not <i>this</i> my answer?</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_THIRTEENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_THIRTEENTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTEENTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>In her different way Christian Ann had arrived at the same
conclusion. Long before the thought came to me she had conceived
the idea that Father Dan and the Reverend Mother were conspiring to
carry me off, and in her dear sweet womanly jealousy (not to speak
of higher and nobler instincts) she had resented this
intensely.</p>
<p>For four days she had smothered her wrath, only revealing it to
baby in half-articulate interviews over the cradle ("We're no women
for these nun bodies, going about the house like ghosts, are we,
<i>villish</i>?"), but on the fifth day it burst into the fiercest
flame and the gentle old thing flung out at everybody.</p>
<p>That was the morning of the departure of the Reverend Mother,
who, after saying good-bye to me in my bedroom, had just returned
to the parlour-kitchen, where Father Dan was waiting to take her to
the railway station.</p>
<p>What provoked Christian Ann's outburst I never rightly knew, for
though the door to the staircase was open, and I could generally
catch anything that was said in the room below (through the open
timbers of the unceiled floor), the soft voice of the Reverend
Mother never reached me, and the Irish roll of Father Dan's vowels
only rumbled up like the sound of a drum.</p>
<p>But Christian Ann's words came sharp and clear as the crack of a
breaker, sometimes trembling with indignation, sometimes quivering
with emotion, and at last thickening into sobs.</p>
<p>"Begging your pardon, ma'am, may I ask what is that you're
saying to the Father about Mary O'Neill? . . . Going back to Rome
is she? To the convent, eh? . . . No, ma'am, that she never will!
Not if I know her, ma'am. Not for any purpose in the world, ma'am.
. . . Temptation, you say? You know best, ma'am, but I don't call
it overcoming temptation&mdash;going into hidlands to get out of
the way of it. . . . Yes, I'm a Christian woman and a good Catholic
too, please the Saints, but asking your pardon, ma'am, I'm not
thinking too much of your convents, or believing the women inside
of them are living such very unselfish lives either, ma'am."</p>
<p>Another soft rumble as of a drum, and then&mdash;</p>
<p>"No, ma'am, no, that's truth enough, ma'am. I've never been a
nun myself, having had better work to do in the world, ma'am. But
it's all as one&mdash;I know what's going on in the convents, I'm
thinking. . . . Harmony and peace, you say? Yes, and jealousy and
envy sometimes, too, or you wouldn't be women like the rest of us,
ma'am. . . . As for Mary O'Neill, <i>she</i> has something better
to do too, I'm thinking. . . . After doing wrong, is she? Maybe she
is, the <i>boght millish</i>, maybe we all are, ma'am, and have
need of God's mercy and forgiveness. But I never heard that praying
is the only kind of penance He asks of us, ma'am. And if it is, I
wouldn't trust but there are poor women who are praying as well
when they're working over their wash-tubs as some ones when they're
saying their rosaries and singing their Tantum Ergos. . . ."</p>
<p>Another interruption and then&mdash;"There's Bella Kinnish
herself who keeps the corner shop, ma'am. Her husband was lost at
the 'mackerel' two years for Easter. He left her with three little
children and a baby unborn, and Bella's finding it middling hard to
get a taste of butcher's meat, or even a bit of loaf-bread itself
for them, ma'am. And when she's sitting late at night, as the
doctor's telling me, and all the rest of the village dark, darning
little Liza's stockings, and patching little Willie's coat, or
maybe nursing the baby when it's down with the measles, the Lord is
as pleased with her, I'm thinking, as with some of your nun bodies
in their grand blue cloaks taking turn and turn to kneel before the
tabernacle."</p>
<p>There was another rumble of apologetic voices after that (both
Father Dan's and the Reverend Mother's), and then came Christian
Ann's clear notes again, breaking fast, though, and sometimes
threatening to stop.</p>
<p>"What's that you're saying, ma'am? . . . Motherhood a sacred and
holy state also? 'Deed it is, ma'am! That's truth enough too,
though some ones who shut themselves up in convents don't seem to
think so. . . . A mother's a mother, and what's more, her child is
her child, wedlock or no wedlock. And if she's doing right by her
little one, and bringing it up well, and teaching it true, I don't
know that when her time comes the Lord will be asking her which
side of her wedding-day it was born on. . . .</p>
<p>"As for Mary O'Neill, ma'am, when you're talking and talking
about her saving her soul, you're forgetting she has her child to
save too, ma'am. God gave her the <i>boght villish</i>, and is she
to run away from it? It's a fine blessing would be on her for that,
isn't it? . . . Father Dan, I'm surprised at you&mdash;such a
terrible, cruel, shocking, unnatural thing as you're thinking. I
thought you were a better man than that&mdash;I really did. . . .
And as for some ones that call themselves Mothers, they're no
mothers at all and never will be&mdash;tempting a poor woman in her
trouble to leave her child to be a charge on other people. . .
."</p>
<p>Still another rumble of soft voices and then&mdash;</p>
<p>"Not that I'm thinking of myself, ma'am. Dear heart, no! It's
only too eager I'd be to have the lil angel to myself. There she is
on the hearthrug, ma'am, and if anything happens to Mary O'Neill,
it's there she'll be for the rest of <i>my</i> life, and it's sorry
I am for the darling's sake that my time cannot be longer. . .
.</p>
<p>"But Mary O'Neill isn't for leaving her little one to go into
any convent. 'Deed no, ma'am! There would be no rest on her if she
did. I'm a mother myself and I know what she'd be feeling. You
might put the black hood on her head, but Nature's a wonderful
powerful thing, and she'd never go to bed at night or get up in the
morning without thinking of her baby. 'Where's she now?' she'd be
asking herself. 'What's happening to my motherless child?' she'd be
saying. And as the years went on she'd be thinking, 'Is she well,
and has she taken her first communion, and is she growing up a good
woman, and what's the world doing on her?' . . .</p>
<p>"No, ma'am, no! Mary O'Neill will go into no convent while her
child is here to be cared for! 'Deed she won't! Not Mary O'Neill!
I'll never believe it of her! Never in this world!"</p>
<p>I heard nothing more for a long time after that&mdash;nothing
but a noise in my own head which drowned all other noises. And when
I recovered my composure the Reverend Mother and Father Dan must
have gone, for there was no sound in the room below except that of
the rocking-chair (which was going rapidly) and Christian Ann's
voice, fierce but broken as if baby had cried and she was
comforting her.</p>
<p>Then a great new spirit came to me. It was Motherhood again! The
mighty passion of motherhood&mdash;which another mighty passion had
temporarily overlaid&mdash;sweeping down on me once more out of the
big, simple, child-like heart of my Martin's mother.</p>
<p>In the fever of body and brain at that moment it seemed to solve
all the problems of life for me.</p>
<p>If the Commandment of God forbade me to marry again because I
had already taken vows before the altar (no matter how innocently
or under what constraint), and if I had committed a sin, a great
sin, and baby was the living sign of it, there was only one thing
left me to do&mdash;to remain as I was and consecrate the rest of
my life to my child.</p>
<p>That would be the real expiation, not burying myself in a
convent. To live for my child! Alone with her! Here, where my sin
had been, to work out my atonement!</p>
<p>This pleased and stirred and uplifted me very much when I first
thought of it. And even when I remembered Martin, and thought how
hard it would be to tear myself away from the love which waited
with open arms for me (So near, so sweet, so precious), there
seemed to be something majestic, almost sublime, in the sacrifice I
was about to make&mdash;the sacrifice of everything in the world
(except one thing) that was dearer to me than life itself.</p>
<p>A sort of spiritual pride came with the thought of this
sacrifice. I saw myself as a woman who, having pledged herself to
God in her marriage and sinned against the law in breaking her
marriage vows, was now going to accept her fate and to humble
herself before the bar of Eternal Justice.</p>
<p>But oh, what a weak, vain thing I was, just when I thought I was
so strong and noble!</p>
<p>After a long day in which I had been fighting back the pains of
my poor torn heart and almost persuading myself that I had won a
victory, a letter came by the evening post which turned all my
great plans to dust and ashes.</p>
<p>The letter was from Martin. Only four little pages, written in
my darling's rugged hand, half serious and half playful, yet they
made the earth rock and reel beneath me.</p>
<div class="blockquot">
<p>"MY DEAR LITTLE WOMAN,&mdash;<i>Just back from Windsor. Stunning
'do.' Tell you all about it when I get back home. Meantime up to my
eyes in work. Arrangements for next Expedition going ahead
splendidly. Had a meeting of the committee yesterday and settled to
sail by the 'Orient' third week in August, so as to get down to
Winter Quarters in time to start south in October</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>Our own little affair has got to come off first, though, so
I'll see the High Bailiff as soon as I return</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>And what do you think, my 'chree'? The boys of the 'Scotia'
are all coming over to Ellan for the great event. 'Deed, yes,

speak of O'Sullivan and old Treacle&mdash;who swears you blew a
kiss to him. They remember you coming down to Tilbury. Aw, God
bless me soul, gel, the way they're talking of you! There's no
holding them at all at all</i>!</p>
<p>"<i>Seriously, darling, you have no time to lose in making your
preparations. My plan is to take you to New Zealand and leave you
at Wellington (good little town, good people, too) while I make my
bit of a trip to the Pole</i>.</p>
<p>"<i>We'll arrange about Girlie when I reach home, which will be

<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_FOURTEENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_FOURTEENTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEENTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>After I had read this letter I saw that my great battle, which I
had supposed to be over, was hardly begun.</p>
<p>Martin was coming home with his big heart full of love for me,
and my own heart ran out to meet him.</p>
<p>He intended to sail for New Zealand the second week in August,
and he expected to take me with him.</p>
<p>In spite of all my religious fears and misgivings, I asked
myself why I should not go? What was to prevent me? What sin had I
really committed? What was there for reparation? Was it anything
more than the letter of the Divine law that I had defied and
broken?</p>
<p>My love was mine and I was his, and I belonged to him for ever.
He was going out on a great errand in the service of humanity.
Couldn't I go to be his partner and helpmate? And if there
<i>had</i> been sin, if the law of God <i>had</i> been broken,
wouldn't that, too, be a great atonement?</p>
<p>Thus my heart fought with my soul, or with my instincts as a
child of the Church, or whatever else it was that brought me back
and back, again and again, in spite of all the struggles of my
love, to the firm Commandment of our Lord.</p>
<p>Father Dan had been right&mdash;I could not get away from that.
The Reverend Mother had been right, too&mdash;other women might
forget that they had broken the Divine law but I never should. If I
married Martin and went away with him, I should always be thinking
of the falseness of my position, and that would make me unhappy. It
would also make Martin unhappy to witness my unhappiness, and that
would be the worst bitterness life could bring.</p>
<p>Then what was left to me? If it was impossible that I should
bury myself in a convent it was equally impossible that I should
live alone, and Martin in the same world with me.</p>
<p>Not all the spiritual pride I could conjure up in the majesty
and solemnity of my self-sacrifice could conquer the yearning of my
heart as a woman. Not all my religious fervour could keep me away
from Martin. In spite of my conscience, sooner or later I should go
to him&mdash;I knew quite well I should. And my child, instead of
being a barrier dividing us, would be a natural bond calling on us
and compelling us to come together.</p>
<p>Then what was left to a woman in my position who believed in the
Divine Commandment&mdash;who could not get away from it? Were all
the doors of life locked to her? Turn which way she would, was
there no way out?</p>
<p>Darker and darker every day became this question, but light came
at last, a kind of light or the promise of light. It was terrible,
and yet it brought me, oh, such immense relief!</p>
<p>I am almost afraid to speak of it, so weak and feeble must any
words be in which I attempt to describe that unforgetable change.
Already I had met some of the mysteries of a woman's life&mdash;now
I was to meet the last, the greatest, the most tragic, and yet the
kindest of them all.</p>
<p>I suppose the strain of emotion I had been going through had
been too much for my physical strength, for three days after the
arrival of Martin's letter I seemed to be really ill.</p>
<p>I am ashamed to dwell on my symptoms, but for a moment I am
forced to do so. My eyes were bright, my cheeks were coloured, and
there was no outward indication of any serious malady. But towards
evening I always had a temperature, and in the middle of the night
(I was sleeping badly) it rose very high, with a rapid pulse and
anxious breathing, and in the morning there was great
exhaustion.</p>
<p>Old Doctor Conrad, who had been coming to me twice a day, began
to look very grave. At last, after a short examination, he said,
rather nervously:</p>
<p>"I should like a colleague from Blackwater to consult with me.
Will you receive him?"</p>
<p>I said "Yes" on one condition&mdash;that if the new doctor had
anything serious to say he should report it first to me.</p>
<p>A little reluctantly Martin's father agreed to my terms and the
consulting physician was sent for. He came early the next
day&mdash;a beautiful Ellan morning with a light breeze from the
sea bringing the smell of new-mown hay from the meadows lying
between.</p>
<p>He was an elderly man, and I could not help seeing a shadow
cross his clean-shaven face the moment his eyes first fell on me.
They were those tender but searching eyes which are so often seen
in doctors, who are always walking through the Valley of the Shadow
and seem to focus their gaze accordingly.</p>
<p>Controlling his expression, he came up to my bed and, taking the
hand I held out to him, he said:</p>
<p>"I trust we'll not frighten you, my lady."</p>
<p>I liked that (though I cared nothing about my lost title, I
thought it was nice of him to remember it), and said I hoped I
should not be too restless.</p>
<p>While he took out and fixed his stethoscope (he had such
beautiful soft hands) he told me that he had had a daughter of my
own age once.</p>
<p>"Once? Where is she now?" I asked him.</p>
<p>"In the Kingdom. She died like a Saint," he answered.</p>
<p>Then he made a long examination (returning repeatedly to the
same place), and when it was over and he raised his face I thought
it looked still more serious.</p>
<p>"My child," he said (I liked that too), "you've never spared
yourself, have you?"</p>
<p>I admitted that I had not.</p>
<p>"When you've had anything to do you've done it, whatever it
might cost you."</p>
<p>I admitted that also. He looked round to see if there was
anybody else in the room (there was only the old doctor, who was
leaning over the end of the bed, watching the face of his
colleague) and then said, in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Has it ever happened that you have suffered from privation and
hard work and loss of sleep and bad lodgings and . . . and
exposure?"</p>
<p>His great searching eyes seemed to be looking straight into my
soul, and I could not have lied to him if I had wished, so I told
him a little (just a little) about my life in London&mdash;at
Bayswater, in the East End and Ilford.</p>
<p>"And did you get wet sometimes, very wet, through all your
clothes?" he asked me.</p>
<p>I told him No, but suddenly remembering that during the cold
days after baby came (when I could not afford a fire) I had dried
her napkins on my body, I felt that I could not keep that fact from
him.</p>
<p>"You dried baby's napkins on your own body?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Sometimes I did. Just for a while," I answered, feeling a
little ashamed, and my tears rising.</p>
<p>"Ah!" he said, and then turning to the old doctor, "What a
mother will do for her child, Conrad!"</p>
<p>The eyes of Doctor Conrad (which seemed to have become swollen)
were still fixed on the face of his colleague, and, speaking as if
he had forgotten that I was present with them in the room, he
said:</p>
<p>"You think she's very ill, don't you?"</p>
<p>"We'll talk of that in your consulting-room," said the strange
doctor.</p>
<p>Then, telling me to lie quiet and they would come back
presently, he went downstairs and Martin's father followed him.</p>
<p>Nurse came up while they were away (she had taken possession of
me during the last few days), and I asked her who were in the
parlour-kitchen.</p>
<p>"Only Father Donovan and Mrs. Conrad&mdash;and baby," she told
me.</p>
<p>Then the doctors came back&mdash;the consultant first, trying to
look cheerful, and the old doctor last, with a slow step and his
head down, as if he had been a prisoner coming back to court to
receive sentence.</p>
<p>"My lady," said the strange doctor, "you are a brave woman if
ever there was one, so we have decided to tell you the truth about
your condition."</p>
<p>And then he told me.</p>
<p>I was not afraid. I will not say that I was not sorry. I could
have wished to live a little longer&mdash;especially now when (but
for the Commandment of God) love and happiness seemed to be within
my grasp.</p>
<p>But oh, the relief! There was something sacred in it, something
supernatural. It was as if God Himself had come down to me in the
bewildering maze that was haunted by the footsteps of my fate and
led me out of it.</p>
<p>Yet why these poor weak words? They can mean so little to
anybody except a woman who has been what I was, and she can have no
need of them.</p>
<p>All fear had vanished from my thoughts. I had no fear for
myself, I remembered, and none for baby. The only regret I felt was
for Martin&mdash;he loved me so; there had never been any other
woman in the world for him.</p>
<p>After a moment I thanked the doctors and hoped I had not given
them too much trouble. Doctor Conrad seemed crushed into
stupefaction and said nothing; but the strange doctor tried to
comfort me by saying there would be no pain, and that my malady was
of a kind that would probably make no outward manifestation.</p>
<p>Being a woman to the end I was very glad of that, and then I
asked him if it would last long. He said No, not long, he feared,
although everything was in God's hands and nobody could say
certainly.</p>
<p>I was saying I was glad of that too, when my quick ears caught a
sound of crying. It was Christian Ann, and Father Dan was hushing
her. I knew what was happening&mdash;the good souls were listening
at the bottom of the stairs.</p>
<p>My first impulse was to send nurse to say they were not to cry.
Then I had half a mind to laugh, so that they might hear me and
know that what I was going through was nothing. But finally I
bethought me of Martin, and asked that they might both be brought
up, for I had something to say to them.</p>
<p>After a moment they came into the room, Christian Ann in her
simple pure dress, and Father Dan in his shabby sack coat, both
looking very sorrowful, the sweet old children.</p>
<p>Then (my two dear friends standing together at the foot of the
bed) I told them what the doctor had said, and warned them that
they were to tell nobody else&mdash;nobody whatever, especially
Martin.</p>
<p>"Leave <i>me</i> to tell <i>him</i>," I said. "Do you faithfully
promise me?"</p>
<p>I could see how difficult it was for them to keep back their
tears, but they gave me their word and that was all I wanted.</p>
<p>"My boy! My poor boy <i>veen!</i> He's thinking there isn't
another woman in the world like her," said Christian Ann.</p>
<p>And then Father Dan said something about my mother extracting
the same promise concerning myself, when I was a child at
school.</p>
<p>After that the Blackwater doctor stepped up to say good-bye.</p>
<p>"I leave you in good hands, but you must let me come to see you
again some day," he said, and then with a playful smile he
added:</p>
<p>"They've got lots of angels up in heaven&mdash;we must try to
keep some of them on earth, you know."</p>
<p>That was on the fifth of July, old Midsummer Day, which is our
national day in Ellan, and flags were flying over many of the
houses in the village.</p>

<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_FIFTEENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_FIFTEENTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTEENTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>JULY 6. I feel so much better to-day. I hardly know what
reaction of my whole being, physical and spiritual, has set in
since yesterday, but my heart is lighter than for a long time, and
sleep, which I had come to look upon as a lost blessing, came to me
last night for four solid hours&mdash;beautiful and untroubled as a
child's.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 8. Martin writes that he expects to be here on the 12th.
Letter full of joyous spirits. "Lots to tell you when I reach home,
dearest." Strange! No mortal can imagine how anxious I am to get
him back, yet I almost dread his coming. When he was away before,
Time could not go fast enough for me. Now it is going too fast. I
know what that means&mdash;the story I have to tell. How am I to
tell it?</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 10. Only two days more and Martin will be here. Of course I
must be up when he arrives. Nurse says No, but I say Yes. To be in
bed when he comes would be too much a shock for him.</p>
<p>"Servants are such domineering tyrants," says Christian Ann, who
never had but one, and "the strange woman" was such a phantom in
the house that the poor mistress was grateful to God when
Hollantide came round and the ghost walked away of itself. My nurse
is a dear, though. How glad I am now that I persuaded Christian Ann
to let her stay.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 12. Martin comes to-day, and the old doctor (with such a
proud and stately step) has gone off to Blackwater to meet him. I
am terribly weak (no pain whatever), but perfectly resolute on
dressing and going downstairs towards tea-time. I shall wear a
white tea-gown, which Sister Mildred gave me in London. Martin
likes me best in white.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>LATER. My Martin has come! We had counted it up that travelling
across the island by motor-car he would arrive at five, so I was
dressed and downstairs by four, sitting in the <i>chiollagh</i> and
watching the road through the window opposite. But he was half an
hour late, and Christian Ann and I were in such a fever that
anybody would have believed it to be half a century and that the
world had stood still.</p>
<p>We might have known what would happen. At Blackwater "the boys"
(the same that "got up the spree" when Martin went away) had
insisted on a demonstration. Then, on reaching our village, Martin
had got down and shaken hands with everybody&mdash;the joiner and
the grocer and the blacksmith and the widow who keeps the corner
shop&mdash;so that it had taken him a quarter of an hour to get
through, amid a general chorus of "The boy he is, though!" and "No
pride at all at all!"</p>
<p>After that he drove home at top speed, and my quick ears caught
the musical hum of the motor as it crossed the bridge. Good
gracious, what excitement!</p>
<p>"Quick nurse, help me to the gate."</p>
<p>I got there just in time to hear a shout, and to see a
precipitate bound out of the car and then . . . what an
embrace!</p>
<p>It is such a good thing my Martin is a big, brawny person, for I
don't know how I should have got back to the house, being so weak
and breathless just then, if his strong arm had not been round my
waist.</p>
<p>Dr. O'Sullivan had come too, looking as gay as a humming-bird,
and after I had finished with Martin I kissed him also (having such
a largesse of affection to distribute generally), whereupon he
blushed like a boy, bless him, and stammered out something about
St. Patrick and St. Thomas, and how he wouldn't have believed
anybody who had said there was anything so sweet, etc.</p>
<p>Martin said I was looking so well, and he, too, declared he
wouldn't have believed any man who had sworn I could have looked so
much better in the time.</p>
<p>My nervous thermometer must have gone up by leaps and bounds
during the next hour, for immediately after tea the old doctor
ordered me back to bed, though I refused to go until he had
faithfully promised that the door to the staircase should be kept
open, so that I could hear what was said downstairs.</p>
<p>What lots of fun they had there! Half the parish must have come
in "to put a sight" on Martin after his investiture, including old
Tommy the Mate, who told everybody over and over again that he had
"known the lad since he was a lump" and "him and me are same as
brothers."</p>
<p>The old doctor's stately pride must have been something to see.
It was "Sir Martin" here and "Sir Martin" there, until I could have
cried to hear him. I felt just as foolish myself, too, for though I
cannot remember that my pulse gave one extra beat when they made me
"your ladyship," now that Martin has become. . . . But that's what
we women are, you see!</p>
<p>At length Martin's big voice came up clear above the rest, and
then the talk was about the visit to Windsor. Christian Ann wanted
to know if he wasn't "freckened" to be there, "not being used of
Kings," whereupon he cried:</p>
<p>"What! Frightened of another man&mdash;and a stunning good one,
too!"</p>
<p>And then came a story of how the King had asked if he hadn't
been in fear of icebergs, and how he had answered No, you could
strike more of them in a day in London (meaning icy-hearted people)
than in a life-time in the Antarctic.</p>
<p>I suppose I must have laughed at that, for the next I heard
was:</p>
<p>"Hush! Isn't that Mary!"</p>
<p>"Aw, yes, the poor <i>veg veen</i>," said a sad voice. It was
Christian Ann's. At the bottom of her heart I shall always be the
child who "sang carvals to her door."</p>
<p>What a wonderful day! I shall not sleep a wink to-night, though.
To-morrow I must tell him.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 13. I intended to tell Martin this morning, but I really
couldn't.</p>
<p>I was going downstairs to breakfast, holding on to the
bannisters at one side and using nurse's shoulder as my other
crutch, when I saw the brightest picture I have ever beheld. Baby
and Martin were on hands and knees on the rag-work hearthrug, face
to face&mdash;Martin calling her to come, Isabel lifting up her
little head to him, like a fledgling in a nest, and both laughing
with that gurgling sound as of water bubbling out of a bottle.</p>
<p>This sight broke all the breath out of me at the very first
moment. And when Martin, after putting me into my place in the
<i>chiollagh</i>, plunged immediately into a rapturous account of
his preparations for our departure&mdash;how we were to be married
by special license at the High Bailiff's on the tenth (if that date
would do), how I was to rest a day and then travel up to London on
the twelfth, and then rest other four days (during which warm
clothes could be bought for me), and sail by the <i>Orient</i> on
the sixteenth&mdash;I could not find it in my heart to tell him
then of the inexorable fate that confronted us.</p>
<p>It was cowardice, I knew, and sooner or later I should have to
pay for it. But when he went on to talk about baby, and appealed to
his mother to say if she wouldn't look after Girlie when I was
gone, and Christian Ann (in such a different tone) said Yes, she
would look after Girlie when I was gone, I decided that I dared not
tell him at all&mdash;I would die rather than do so.</p>
<p>The end of it all is that I have arranged with Christian Ann,
the old doctor, and Father Dan that Time and Martin's own
observation are to tell him what is going to happen, and none of us
are to say anything about it.</p>
<p>What a deceiver I am, though! I put it all down to my unselfish
love for Martin. It would be such a blow to him&mdash;disturbing
his plans, upsetting everything, perhaps causing him to postpone
his Expedition, or even to abandon it altogether. "Let the truth
fall soft on him. He'll see it soon enough. Don't let us be
cruel."</p>
<p>The dear sweet, unsuspecting old darlings have taken it all
in&mdash;all my vain and cowardly selfishness. I am to play the
part of pretending to fall in with Martin's plans, and they are to
stand by and say nothing.</p>
<p>Can I do it? I wonder, I wonder!</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 15. I am becoming quite a great actress! It's astonishing
to see how I develop my deceptions under all sorts of veils and
disguises.</p>
<p>Martin told me to-day that he had given up the idea of leaving
me at Wellington and had determined to take me on to Winter
Quarters, having met, on the way to Windsor, some great specialist
in my kind of malady (I wonder how much he knows of it), who
declared that the climate of the Antarctic would act on me like
magic.</p>
<p>Such glorious sunshine in summer! Such crisp, dry, stimulating
air! New life with every breath! Such a stunning little house, too,
so cosy and comfortable! And then the men whom he would leave
behind while he slipped down South&mdash;they would worship me!</p>
<p>"How splendid! How glorious!" I cried. "How delightful to be
mistress over a houseful of big, hungry, healthy boys, who come in
out of the snow and want to eat up everything!"</p>
<p>Sometimes I feel myself being carried away by my own acting, and
then I see the others (Christian Ann and the old doctor and Father
Dan) dropping their heads or stealing out of the room.</p>
<p>I wish I were not so weak. I feel no pain whatever. Only this
temperature during the nights and the ever-deepening exhaustion in
the mornings.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 16. I am keeping it up! To-day I was alone with Martin for
a long hour in the garden-house. Weather soft and beautiful, the
heavens blue, and gleams of sunshine coming through the
trellis-work.</p>
<p>Merely to sit beside my darling with his odour of health is to
feel a flood of bodily strength coursing through me, enough to make
me forget that I am a frail thing myself, who could be blown away
by a puff of wind. But to hear him talk on his own subject is to be
lifted up to the highest reaches of the soul.</p>
<p>I always say there is a dumb poet in every explorer; but the
poet wasn't dumb to-day when Martin talked about the cyclone or
anticyclone, or whatever it is which covers the region of the South
Pole like a cap, and determines the weather of a great part of the
habitable globe.</p>
<p>"We are going to take from God his word and pass it on to the
world," he said.</p>
<p>After that he made reference (for the first time since his
return) to the difficulties of our position, saying what a glorious
thing it would be to escape to that great free region from the
world of civilisation, with its effete laws and worn-out creeds
which enslave humanity.</p>
<p>"Only a month to-day until we start, and you'll be well enough
to travel then, dearest."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, only a month to-day, and I shall be well enough then,
dearest."</p>
<p>Oh, Mary O'Neill! How much longer will you be able to keep it
up, dear?</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 17. Martin brought the proofs of his new book from London,
and to-day in the summer-house (bluebells paling out and hanging
their heads, but the air full of the odour of fruit trees) he and
Dr. O'Sullivan and I have been correcting "galleys"&mdash;the
doctor reading aloud, Martin smoking his briar-root pipe, and I (in
a crater of cushions) supposed to be sitting as judge and jury.</p>
<p>Such simple, straight, natural writing! There may have been a
thousand errors but my ears heard none of them. The breathless bits
about the moments when death was near; the humorous bits about
patching the tent with the tails of their shirts when an overturned
lamp burnt a hole in the canvas&mdash;this was all I was conscious
of until I was startled by the sound of a sepulchral voice,
groaning out "Oh Lord a-massy me!" and by the sight of a Glengarry
cap over the top of the fuchsia hedge. Old Tommy was listening from
the road.</p>
<p>We sat late over our proofs and then, the dew having begun to
fall, Martin said he must carry me indoors lest my feet should get
wet&mdash;which he did, with the result that, remembering what had
happened on our first evening at Castle Raa, I had a pretty fit of
hysterics as soon as we reached the house.</p>
<p>"Let's skip, Commanther," was the next thing I heard, and then I
was helped upstairs to bed.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 18. What a flirt I am becoming! Having conceived the idea
that Dr. O'Sullivan is a little wee bit in love with me too, I have
been playing him off against Martin.</p>
<p>It was so delicious (after all I have gone through) to have two
magnificent men, out of the heroic youth of the world, waiting hand
and foot on one little woman, that the feminine soul in me to-day
couldn't resist the temptation to an innocent effort at
coquetry.</p>
<p>So before we began business on the proofs I told Martin that, if
he was determined to leave me behind at winter quarters while he
went away to the Pole, he must allow Dr. O'Sullivan to remain
behind to take care of me.</p>
<p>Of course the doctor rose to my bait like a dear, crying:</p>
<p>"He will too&mdash;by St. Patrick and St. Thomas he will, and a
mighty proud man he'll be entirely. . . ."</p>
<p>But good gracious! A momentary shadow passed over Martin's face,
then came one of his big broad smiles, then out shot his clinched
fist, and . . . the poor doctor and his garden seat were rolling
over each other on the grass.</p>
<p>However, we got through without bloodshed, and did good day's
work on the book.</p>
<p>I must not write any more. I have always written in my own book
at night, when I haven't been able to get any kind of Christian
sleep; but I'm weaker now, so must stop, lest I shouldn't have
strength enough for Martin's.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 20. Oh dear! I am dragging all these other poor dears into
my deceptions. Christian Ann does not mind what lies, or half-lies,
she has to tell in order to save pain to her beloved son. But the
old doctor! And Father Dan!</p>
<p>To-day itself, as Martin's mother would say, I had to make my
poor old priest into a shocking story-teller.</p>
<p>I developed a cough a few weeks ago, and though it is not really
of much account I have been struggling to smother it while Martin
has been about, knowing he is a doctor himself, and fearing his ear
might detect the note.</p>
<p>But this afternoon (whether a little damp, with a soft patter of
sweet rain on the trees and the bushes) I had a rather bad bout, at
which Martin's face looked grave, until I laughed and said:</p>
<p>"It's nothing! I've had this sort of cough every summer since I
was born&mdash;haven't I, Father Dan?"</p>
<p>"Ye-es."</p>
<p>I shall have to remember that in my next confession, but what
Father Dan is to do I really don't know.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 21. I have been rather down to-day about a newspaper that
came to me anonymously from Paris, with a report marked for my
special delectation.</p>
<p>"FASHIONABLE MARRIAGE OF AN ENGLISH PEER AND AN AMERICAN
HEIRESS."</p>
<p>My husband's and Alma's! It took place at the American Embassy,
and was attended by great numbers of smart people. There was a long
account of the grandeur of the bride's dress and of the splendour
of the bridegroom's presents. They have taken an apartment on the
Champs Elys&eacute;es and will spend most of the year in Paris.</p>
<p>Ah well, why should I trouble about a matter that so little
concerns me? Alma is still beautiful; she will be surrounded by
admirers; her salon will be frequented by the fashionable parasites
of Europe and America.</p>
<p>As for my husband, the straw-fire of his wife's passion for him
will soon burn out, especially now that she has gained what she
wanted&mdash;his name, his title.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Martin carried me upstairs to bed to-night. I was really feeling
weaker than usual, but we made a great game of it. Nurse went
first, behind a mountain of pillows; Martin and I came next, with
his arms about my body and mine around his neck; and Dr. O'Sullivan
last, carrying two tall brass candlesticks.</p>
<p>How we laughed! We all laughed together, as if trying to see
which of us could laugh the loudest. Only Christian Ann looked
serious, standing at the bottom of the stairs, nursing baby in her
nightdress.</p>
<p>It is three o'clock in the morning as I write, and I can hear
our laughter still&mdash;only it sounds like sobbing now.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 22. Have heard something to-day that has taken all the
warmth of life out of me. It is about my father, whom the old
doctor still attends. Having been told of my husband's marriage he
has announced his intention of claiming my child if anything
happens to me!</p>
<p>What his object may be I do not know. He cannot be thinking of
establishing a claim to my husband's title&mdash;Isabel being a
girl. Remembering something his lawyer said about the marriage
settlement when I consulted him on the subject of divorce, I can
only assume that (now he is poor) he is trying to recover the
inheritance he settled on my husband.</p>
<p>It frightens me&mdash;raising my old nightmare of a lawsuit
about the legitimacy of my child. I want to speak to Martin about
it. Yet how can I do so without telling him the truth which I have
been struggling so hard to conceal?</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 23. Oh, Mary O'Neill, what are you coming to?</p>
<p>I told Martin about father's threat, only I gave it another
colour. He had heard of the Reverend Mother's visit, so I said the
rumour had reached my father that I intended to enter a convent,
and he had declared that, if I did so, he would claim my child from
Christian Ann, being its nearest blood relation.</p>
<p>"Can he do so&mdash;when I am . . . when we are gone?" I
asked.</p>
<p>I thought Martin's strong face looked sterner than I had ever
seen it. He made a vague reply and left me soon afterwards on some
sort of excuse.</p>
<p>About an hour later he came back to carry me upstairs, and just
as he was setting me down, and Christian Ann was coming in with the
candles, he whispered:</p>
<p>"Don't worry about Girlie. I've settled that matter, I'm
thinking."</p>
<p>What has he done, I wonder?</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM OF MARTIN CONRAD</p>
<p>What I had done is easily told. I had gone straight to Daniel
O'Neill himself, intending to know the truth of the story and to
act accordingly.</p>
<p>Already I knew enough to scent mischief. I could not be so
stupefied into blindness of what was going on under my eyes as not
to see that the dirty question of money, and perhaps the dirtier
question of the aims and expectations of the woman MacLeod, were at
the root of the matter that was distressing my darling.</p>
<p>Daniel O'Neill had left the Big House and gone to live in his
mother's old cottage for two reasons&mdash;first, to delude the law
into the idea that he was himself utterly ruined by the bankruptcy
to which he had brought the whole island; and next, to gratify the
greed of his mistress, who wanted to get him to herself at the end,
so that he might be persuaded to marry her (if it were only on his
death-bed) and so establish, against any claim of his daughter's,
her widow's rights in what a husband leaves behind him&mdash;which
is half of everything in Ellan.</p>
<p>What connection this had with the man's desire to get hold of
the child I had yet to learn; but I meant to learn it without
another hour's delay, so I set off for the cottage on the
curragh.</p>
<p>It was growing dark, and not being sure of my way through the
ever-changing bypaths of the bog land, I called on Father Dan to
guide me. The old priest seemed to know my errand (the matter my
darling had communicated as a secret being common knowledge), and
at first he looked afraid.</p>
<p>"Well . . . yes, yes . . . why shouldn't I?" he said, and then,
"Yes, I will, I will"&mdash;with the air of a man who had made up
his mind to a daring enterprise.</p>
<p>Our curragh is a stretch of wild marsh lying over against the
sea, undrained, only partly cultivated, half covered with sedge and
sallow bushes, and consequently liable to heavy mists. There was a
mist over it that night, and hence it was not easy even for Father
Dan (accustomed to midnight visits to curragh cottages) to find the
house which had once been the home of "Neale the Lord."</p>
<p>We rooted it out at last by help of the parish constable, who
was standing at the corner of a by-road talking to the coachman of
a gorgeous carriage waiting there, with its two splendid horses
smoking in the thick night air.</p>
<p>When, over the shingle of what we call "the street," we reached
the low straggling crofter-cottage under its thick trammon tree
(supposed to keep off the evil spirits), I rapped with my knuckles
at the door, and it was opened by a tall scraggy woman with a
candle in her hand.</p>
<p>This was Nessy MacLeod, harder and uglier than ever, with her
red hair combed up, giving her the appearance of a bunch of carrots
over two stalks of rhubarb.</p>
<p>Almost before I had time to say that we had come to see Mr.
O'Neill, and to step into the house while saying so, a hoarse,
husky, querulous man's voice cried from within:</p>
<p>"Who is it, Nessy?"</p>
<p>It's Father Dan, and Martin . . . I mean Sir. . . ."</p>
<p>"That'll do," I said, and the next moment we were in the
living-room&mdash;a bare, bleak, comfortless Curraghman's
kitchen.</p>
<p>A more incongruous sight than we saw there human eyes never
beheld.</p>
<p>Daniel O'Neill, a shadow of the big brute creature he once was,
a shrivelled old man, with his bony hands scored and contracted
like an autumn leaf, his shrunken legs scarcely showing through his
baggy trousers, his square face whiter than the wall behind it, and
a piece of red flannel hanging over his head like a cowl, sat in
the elbow-chair at the side of the hearth-fire, while at a deal
table, which was covered with papers that looked like law deeds and
share certificates (being stamped and sealed), sat the Bishop of
the island, and its leading lawyer, Mr. Curphy.</p>
<p>On hearing my name and seeing me enter the house, Daniel O'Neill
lost all control of himself. He struggled to his feet by help of a
stick, and as I walked up to him he laid hold of me.</p>
<p>"You devil!" he cried. "You infernal villain! You. . . ."</p>
<p>But it is of no use to repeat what else he said in the fuming of
his rage, laying hold of me by the collar of my coat, and tugging
at it as if he would drag me to his feet.</p>
<p>I was half sorry for the man, badly as I thought of him, so I
only opened his hand (easy enough to do, for the grip was gone from
it) and said:</p>
<p>"You're an old man, sir, and you're a sick man&mdash;don't tempt
me to forget that you are the father of Mary O'Neill. Sit
down."</p>
<p>He sat down, breathless and broken, without another word. But
the Bishop, with a large air of outraged dignity, faced about to
poor Father Dan (who was standing near the door, turning his round
hat in his trembling hands) and said:</p>
<p>"Father Donovan, did you know that Mr. O'Neill was very
ill?"</p>
<p>"I did, Monsignor," said Father Dan.</p>
<p>"And that a surgeon is coming from London to perform an
operation upon him&mdash;did you know that?"</p>
<p>"I did, Monsignor."</p>
<p>"Did you know also that I was here to-night to attend with Mr.
Curphy to important affairs and perhaps discharge some sacred
duties?"</p>
<p>"I knew that too, Monsignor."</p>
<p>"Then," said the Bishop, pointing at me, "how dare you bring
this man here&mdash;this man of all others, who has been the chief
instrument in bringing shame and disgrace upon our poor sick friend
and his deeply injured family?"</p>
<p>"So that's how you look at it, is it, Monsignor?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, that is how I look at it, and I am sorry for a priest
of my Church who has so weakened his conscience by sympathy with
notorious sinners as to see things in any other light."</p>
<p>"Sinners, Bishop?"</p>
<p>"Didn't you hear me, Father Donovan? Or do you desire me to use
a harder name for them&mdash;for one of them in particular, on whom
you have wasted so much weak sentimentality, to the injury of your
spiritual influence and the demoralisation of your parish. I have
warned you already. Do you wish me to go further, to remove you
from your Presbytery, or perhaps report your conduct to those who
have power to take the frock off your back? What standard of
sanctity for the sacrament of Holy Matrimony do you expect to
maintain while you degrade it by openly associating with a woman
who has broken her marriage vows and become little better . . . I
grieve to say it [with a deep inclination of the head towards the
poor wreck in the elbow-chair] little better than a common. . .
."</p>
<p>I saw the word that was coming, and I was out in an instant. But
there was somebody before me. It was Father Dan. The timid old
priest seemed to break in one moment the bonds of a life-long
tyranny.</p>
<p>"What's that you say, Monsignor?" he cried in a shrill voice.
"<i>I</i> degrade the sacrament of Holy Matrimony? Never in this
world! But if there's anybody in the island of Ellan who has done
that same every day of his life, it's yourself, and never more
cruelly and shamefully than in the case we're talking of at this
present speaking."</p>
<p>"I'm not used to this kind of language from my clergy, Father
Donovan," began the Bishop, but before he could say more Father Dan
caught him up by crying:</p>
<p>"Perhaps not, Monsignor. But you've got to hear for once, and
that's now. When this man [pointing to Daniel O'Neill] for his own
purposes wanted to marry his daughter (who was a child and had no
choice in the matter) to one of another faith, a man who didn't
believe in the sacrament of marriage as we know it, who was it that
paved the way for him?"</p>
<p>"You actually mean that <i>I</i>. . . ."</p>
<p>"I mean that without your help, Monsignor, a good girl could
never have been married to a bad man. You didn't act in ignorance,
either. When somebody told you&mdash;somebody who is here
now&mdash;that the man to whom you were going to marry that
innocent girl was a notorious loose liver, a profligate, a
reprobate, a betrayer of women, and a damned scoundrel. . . ."</p>
<p>"Go on, Father Dan; that's God's own name for him," I said, when
the old priest caught his breath for a moment, terrified by the
word that had burst from his lips.</p>
<p>"Let's have an end of this," said the Bishop mightily.</p>
<p>"Wait a bit, sir," I said, and then Father Dan went on to say
how he had been told there was nothing to my story, and how he had
been forbidden to inquire into it.</p>
<p>"That's how you made <i>me</i> a party to this wicked marriage,
God and his Holy Mother pardon me! And now that it has come to the
end you might have expected, and the poor helpless child who was
bought and sold like a slave is in the position of the sinner, you
want me to cut her off, to turn the hearts of all good people
against her, to cast her out of communion, to make her a thing to
point the finger at&mdash;me, her spiritual father who baptized
her, taking her out of the arms of the angel who bore her and
giving her to Christ&mdash;or if I won't you'll deprive me of my
living, you'll report me to Rome, you'll unfrock me. . . ."</p>
<p>"Do it, Monsignor," cried Father Dan, taking a step nearer to
the Bishop and lifting a trembling hand over his head. "Do it, if
our holy Church will permit you, and I'll put a wallet on my old
shoulders and go round the houses of my parish in my old age,
begging a bite of bread and a basin of meal, and sleeping under a
thorn bush, rather than lay my head on my pillow and know that that
poor victim of your wicked scheming is in the road."</p>
<p>The throbbing and breaking of the old priest's voice had
compelled me to drop my head, and it was not until I heard the
sneck of the lock of the outer door that I realised that, overcome
by his emotion, he had fled from the house.</p>
<p>"And now I guess you can follow your friend," said Daniel
O'Neill.</p>
<p>"Not yet, sir," I answered; "I have something to say first."</p>
<p>"Well, well, what is it, please?" said the lawyer sharply and
insolently, looking to where I was standing with folded arms at one
side of the hearth-place.</p>
<p>"You'll hear soon enough, Master Curphy," I answered.</p>
<p>Then, turning back to Daniel O'Neill, I told him what rumour had
reached my dear one of his intentions with regard to her child, and
asked him to say whether there was any truth in it.</p>
<p>"Answer the man, Curphy," said Daniel O'Neill, and thereupon the
lawyer, with almost equal insolence, turned to me and said:</p>
<p>"What is it you wish to know, sir?"</p>
<p>"Whether, if Mary O'Neill is unable from any cause to keep
control of her child (which God forbid!), her father intends to
take possession of it."</p>
<p>"Why shouldn't he? If the mother dies, for instance, her father
will be the child's legal guardian."</p>
<p>"But if by that time the father is dead too&mdash;what
then?"</p>
<p>"Then the control of the child will&mdash;with the consent of
the court&mdash;devolve upon his heir and representative."</p>
<p>"Meaning this lady?" I asked, pointing to the woman MacLeod, who
was now standing at the back of Daniel O'Neill's chair.</p>
<p>"Possibly."</p>
<p>"And what will she do with it?"</p>
<p>"Do with it?"</p>
<p>The lawyer was running his fingers through his long beard and
trying to look perplexed.</p>
<p>"Mr. Curphy, I'll ask you not to pretend to be unable to
understand me. If and when this lady gets possession of Mary
O'Neill's child, what is she going to do with it?"</p>
<p>"Very well," said the advocate, seeing I meant business, "since
my client permits me to speak, I'll tell you plainly. Whatever the
child's actual parentage . . . perhaps you know best. . . ."</p>
<p>"Go on, sir."</p>
<p>"Whatever the child's parentage, it was born in wedlock. Even
the recent divorce proceedings have not disturbed that. Therefore
we hold that the child has a right to the inheritance which in due
time should come to Mary O'Neill's offspring by the terms of the
settlement upon her husband."</p>
<p>It was just as I expected, and every drop of my blood boiled at
the thought of my darling's child in the hands of that
frozen-hearted woman.</p>
<p>"So that is the law, is it?"</p>
<p>"That is the law in Ellan."</p>
<p>"In the event of Mary O'Neill's death, and her father's death,
her child and all its interests will come into the hands of. . .
."</p>
<p>"Of her father's heir and representative."</p>
<p>"Meaning, again, this lady?"</p>
<p>"Probably."</p>
<p>The woman at the back of the chair began to look restless.</p>
<p>"I don't know, sir," she said, "if your repeated references to
me are intended to reflect upon my character, or my ability to
bring up the child well and look after its interests properly."</p>
<p>"They are, madam&mdash;they most certainly and assuredly are," I
answered.</p>
<p>"Daniel!" she cried.</p>
<p>"Be quiet, gel," said Daniel O'Neill. "Let the man speak. We'll
see what he has come for presently. Go on, sir."</p>
<p>I took him at his word, and was proceeding to say that as I
understood things it was intended to appeal to the courts in order
to recover (nominally for the child) succession to the money which
had been settled on Mary O'Neill's husband at the time of their
marriage, when the old man cried, struggling again to his feet:</p>
<p>"There you are! The money! It's the money the man's after! He
took my daughter, and now he's for taking my fortune&mdash;what's
left of it, anyway. He shan't, though! No, by God he shan't! . . .
Go back to your woman, sir. Do you hear me?&mdash;your woman, and
tell her that neither you nor she shall touch one farthing of my
fortune. I'm seeing to that now. It's what we're here for
to-night&mdash;before that damnable operation to-morrow, for nobody
knows what will come of it. She has defied me and ruined me, and
made me the byword of the island, God's curse on her. . . ."</p>
<p>"Daniel! Daniel!" cried the MacLeod woman, trying to pacify the
infuriated madman and to draw him back to his seat.</p>
<p>I would have given all I had in the world if Daniel O'Neill
could have been a strong man at that moment, instead of a poor wisp
of a thing with one foot in the grave. But I controlled myself as
well as I could and said:</p>
<p>"Mr. O'Neill, your daughter doesn't want your fortune, and as
for myself, you and your money are no more to me than an old hen
sitting on a nest of addled eggs. Give it to the lady at the back
of your chair&mdash;she has earned it, apparently."</p>
<p>"Really," said the Bishop, who had at length recovered from
Father Dan's onslaught. "Really, Sir What-ever-your-name is, this
is too outrageous&mdash;that you should come to this lonely house
at this time of night, interrupting most urgent business, not to
speak of serious offices, and make injurious insinuations against
the character of a respectable person&mdash;you, sir, who had the
audacity to return openly to the island with the partner of your
sin, and to lodge her in the house of your own mother&mdash;your
own mother, sir, though Heaven knows what kind of mother it can be
who harbours her son's sin-laden mistress, his woman, as our sick
friend says. . . ."</p>
<p>Lord! how my hands itched! But controlling myself again, with a
mighty effort I said:</p>
<p>"Monsignor, I don't think I should advise you to say that
again."</p>
<p>"Why not, sir?"</p>
<p>"Because I have a deep respect for your cloth and should be
sorry to see it soiled."</p>
<p>"Violence!" cried the Bishop, rising to his feet. "You threaten
me with violence? . . . Is there no policeman in this parish, Mr.
Curphy?"</p>
<p>"There's one at the corner of the road, Bishop," I said. "I
brought him along with me. I should have brought the High Bailiff
too, if there had been time. You would perhaps be no worse for a
few witnesses to the business that seems to be going on here."</p>
<p>Saying this, as I pointed to the papers on the table, I had hit
harder than I knew, for both the Bishop and the lawyer (who had
also risen) dropped back into their seats and looked at each other
with expressions of surprise.</p>
<p>Then, stepping up to the table, so as to face the four of them,
I said, as calmly and deliberately as I could:</p>
<p>"Now listen to me. I am leaving this island in about three weeks
time, and expect to be two years&mdash;perhaps three
years&mdash;away. Mary O'Neill is going with me&mdash;as my wife.
She intends to leave her child in the care of my mother, and I
intend to promise her that she may set her mind at ease that it
shall never under any circumstances be taken away. You seem to have
made up your minds that she is going to die. Please God she may
disappoint your expectations and come back strong and well. But if
she does not, and I have to return alone, and if I find that her
child has been removed from the protection in which she left it, do
you know what I shall do?"</p>
<p>"Go to the courts, I presume," said the lawyer.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, no! I'll go to no courts, Mr. Curphy. I'll go to the
people who have set the courts in motion&mdash;which means that
I'll go to <i>you</i> and <i>you</i> and <i>you</i> and <i>you</i>.
Heaven knows how many of us may be living when that day comes; but
as surely as I am, if I find that the promise I made to Mary
O'Neill has been a vain one, and that her child is under this
woman's control and the subject of a lawsuit about this man's
money, and she in her grave, as surely as the Lord God is above us
there isn't one soul of you here present who will be alive the
following morning."</p>
<p>That seemed to be enough for all of them. Even old Daniel
O'Neill (the only man in the house who had an ounce of fight in
him) dropped his head back in his chair, with his mouth wide open
and his broken teeth showing behind his discoloured lips.</p>
<p>I thought Father Dan would have been waiting for me under the
trammon on "the street," but he had gone back to the Presbytery and
sent Tommy the Mate to lead me through the mist and the by-lanes to
the main road.</p>
<p>The old salt seemed to have a "skute" into the bad business
which had brought out the Bishop and the lawyer at that late hour,
and on parting from me at the gate of Sunny Lodge he said:</p>
<p>"Lord-a-massy me, what for hasn't ould Tom Dug a fortune coming
to him?"</p>
<p>And when I asked him what he would do with a fortune if he had
one he answered:</p>
<p>"Do? Have a tunderin' [thundering] good law-shoot and sattle
some o' them big fellas."</p>
<p>Going to bed in the "Plough" that night, I had an ugly vision of
the scene being enacted in the cottage on the curragh (a scene not
without precedent in the history of the world, though the
priesthood as a whole is so pure and noble)&mdash;the midnight
marriage of a man dying in unnatural hatred of his own daughter
(and she the sweetest woman in the world) while the priest and the
prostitute divided the spoils.</p>
<p>[END OF MARTIN CONRAD'S MEMORANDUM]</p>
<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="ONE_HUNDRED_AND_SIXTEENTH_CHAPTER" id=
"ONE_HUNDRED_AND_SIXTEENTH_CHAPTER"></a>ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTEENTH
CHAPTER</h2>
<p>JULY 25. The old doctor brought me such sad and startling news
to-day. My poor father is dead&mdash;died yesterday, after an
operation which he had deferred too long, refusing to believe it
necessary.</p>
<p>The dreadful fact has hitherto been kept secret not only from me
but from everybody, out of fear of legal proceedings arising from
the failure of banks, &amp;c., which has brought the whole island
to the verge of bankruptcy.</p>
<p>He was buried this morning at old St. Mary's&mdash;very early,
almost before daybreak, to suit the convenience of the Bishop, who
wished to catch the first steamer <i>en route</i> for Rome.</p>
<p>As a consequence of these strange arrangements, and the secrecy
that has surrounded my father's life of late, people are saying
that he is not dead at all, that in order to avoid prosecution he
has escaped from the island (going off with the Bishop in a sort of
disguise), and that the coffin put into the grave this morning did
not contain a human body.</p>
<p>"But that's all wrong," said the old doctor. "Your father is
really dead and buried, and the strange man who went away with the
Bishop was the London surgeon who performed the operation."</p>
<p>I can hardly realise it&mdash;that the strong, stalwart being,
the stern old lion whose heavy foot, tramping through my poor
mother's room, used to make the very house shake, is gone.</p>
<p>He died as he had lived, it seems. To the last self-centred,
inflexible, domineering&mdash;a peasant yet a great man (if
greatness is to be measured by power), ranking, I think, in his own
little scene of life with the tragic figures of history.</p>
<p>I have spent the day in bitter grief. Ever since I was a child
there has been a dark shadow between my father and me. He was like
a beetling mountain, always hanging over my head. I wonder whether
he wished to see me at the end. Perhaps he did, and was
over-persuaded by the cold and savourless nature of Nessy MacLeod,
who is giving it out, I hear, that grief and shame for me killed
him.</p>
<p>People will say he was a vulgar parvenu, a sycophant, a
snob&mdash;heaven knows what. All wrong! For the true reading of
his character one has to go back to the day when he was a ragged
boy and the liveried coachman of the "bad Lord Raa" lashed at his
mother on the road, and he swore that when he was a man she should
have a carriage of her own, and then "nobody should never lash
her."</p>
<p>He found Gessler's cap in the market-place and was no more
willing than Tell to bend the knee to it.</p>
<p>My poor father! He did wrong to use another life, another soul,
for either his pride or his revenge. But God knows best how it will
be with him, and if he was the first cause of making my life what
it has been, I send after him (I almost tremble to say it) if not
my love, my forgiveness.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 26. I begin to realise that after all I was not romancing
when I told the old dears that Martin and his schemes would
collapse if I failed him. Poor boy, he is always talking as it
everything depended upon me. It is utterly frightening to think
what would happen to the Expedition if he thought I could not sail
with him on the sixteenth.</p>
<p>Martin is not one of the men who weep for their wives as if the
sun had suffered eclipse, and then marry again before their graves
are green. So, having begun on my great scheme of pretending that I
am getting better every day, and shall be "ready to go, never
fear," I have to keep it up.</p>
<p>I begin to suspect, though, that I am not such a wonderful
actress after all. Sometimes in the midst of my raptures I see him
looking at me uneasily as if he were conscious of a certain effort.
At such moments I have to avoid his eyes lest anything should
happen, for my great love seems to be always lying in wait to break
down my make-believe.</p>
<p>To-day (though I had resolved not to give way to tears) when he
was talking about the voyage out, and how it would "set me up" and
how the invigorating air of the Antarctic would "make another woman
of me," I cried:</p>
<p>"How splendid! How glorious!"</p>
<p>"Then why are you crying?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Oh, good gracious, that's nothing&mdash;for <i>me</i>," I
answered.</p>
<p>But if I am throwing dust in Martin's eyes I am deceiving nobody
else, it seems. To-night after he and Dr. O'Sullivan had gone back
to the "Plough," Father Dan came in to ask Christian Ann how she
found me, and being answered rather sadly, I heard him say:</p>
<p>"<i>Ugh cha nee!</i> [Woe is me!] What is life? It is even a
vapour which appeareth for a little while and then vanisheth
away."</p>
<p>And half an hour later, when old Tommy came to bring me some
lobsters (he still declares they are the only food for invalids)
and to ask "how's the lil woman now?" I heard him moaning, as he
was going out:</p>
<p>"There'll be no shelter for her this voyage, the <i>vogh!</i>
She'll carry the sea in with her to the Head, I'm thinking."</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 27. I <i>must</i> keep it up&mdash;I must, I must! To allow
Martin's hopes and dreams to be broken in upon now would be enough
to kill me outright.</p>
<p>I don't want to be unkind, but some explorers leave the
impression that their highest impulse is the praise of achievement,
and once they have done something all they've got to do next is to
stay at home and talk about it. Martin is not like that.
Exploration is a passion with him. The "lure of the little voices"
and the "call of the Unknown" have been with him from the
beginning, and they will be with him to the end.</p>
<p>I cannot possibly think of Martin dying in bed, and being laid
to rest in the green peace of English earth&mdash;dear and sweet as
that is to tamer natures, mine for instance. I can only think of
that wild heroic soul going up to God from the broad white
wilderness of the stormy South, and leaving his body under heaving
hummocks of snow with blizzards blowing a requiem over his
grave.</p>
<p>Far off may that glorious ending be, but shall my poor failing
heart make it impossible? Never, never, never!</p>
<p>Moral&mdash;I'm going to get up every day&mdash;whatever my
nurse may say.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 28. I was rocking baby to sleep this afternoon when
Christian Ann, who was spinning by the fire, told me of a quarrel
between Aunt Bridget and Nessy MacLeod.</p>
<p>It seems that Nessy (who says she was married to my father
immediately before the operation) claims to be the heiress of all
that is left, and as the estate includes the Big House she is
"putting the law on" Aunt Bridget to obtain possession.</p>
<p>Poor Aunt Bridget! What a pitiful end to all her scheming for
Betsy Beauty, all her cruelties to my long-suffering mother, all
her treatment of me&mdash;to be turned out of doors by her own
step-daughter!</p>
<p>When old Tommy heard of the lawsuit, he said:</p>
<p>"Chut! Sarves her right, I say! It's the black life the Big
Woman lived before, and it's the black life she'll be living now,
and her growing old, and the Death looking in on her."</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 29. We have finished the proofs to-day and Dr. O'Sullivan
has gone back with them. I thought he looked rather <i>wae</i> when
he came to say good-bye to me, and though he made a great deal of
noise his voice was husky when (swearing by his favourite Saints)
he talked about "returning for the tenth with all the boys,
including Treacle."</p>
<p>Of course that was nonsense about his being in love with me. But
I'm sure he loves me all the same&mdash;many, many people love me.
I don't know what I've done to deserve all this love. I have had a
great deal of love in my life now that I come to think of it.</p>
<p>We worked hard over the last of the proofs, and I suppose I was
tired at the end of them, for when Martin carried me upstairs
to-night there was less laughter than usual, and I thought he
looked serious as he set me down by the bed.</p>
<p>I bantered him about that ("A penny for your thoughts, mister"),
but towards midnight the truth flashed upon me&mdash; I am becoming
thinner and therefore lighter every day, and he is beginning to
notice it.</p>
<p>Moral&mdash;I must try to walk upstairs in future.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 30. Ah, me! it looks as if it were going to be a race
between me and the Expedition&mdash;which shall come off
first&mdash;and sometimes I am afraid I am going to be the
loser!</p>
<p>Martin ought to sail on the sixteenth&mdash;only seventeen days!
I am expected to be married on the tenth&mdash;only eleven! Oh,
Mary O'Neill, what a strange contradictory war you are waging! Look
straight before you, dear, and don't be afraid.</p>
<p>I had a letter from the Reverend Mother this evening. She is
crossing from Ireland to-morrow, which is earlier than she
intended, so I suppose Father Dan must have sent for her.</p>
<p>I do hope Martin and she will get on comfortably together. A
struggle between my religion and my love would he more than I could
bear now.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>JULY 31. When I awoke this morning very late (I had slept after
daybreak) I was thinking of the Reverend Mother, but lo! who should
come into the room but the doctor from Blackwater!</p>
<p>He was very nice; said I had promised to let him see me again,
so he had taken me at my word.</p>
<p>I watched him closely while he examined me, and I could see that
he was utterly astonished&mdash;couldn't understand how I came to
be alive&mdash;and said he would never again deny the truth of the
old saying about dying of a broken heart, because I was clearly
living by virtue of a whole one.</p>
<p>I made pretence of wanting something in order to get nurse out
of the room, and then reached lip to the strange doctor and
whispered "<i>When?</i>"</p>
<p>He wasn't for telling me, talked about the miraculous power of
God which no science could reckon with, but at last I got a word
out of him which made me happy, or at least content.</p>
<p>Perhaps it's sad, but many things look brighter that are far
more sorrowful&mdash;dying of a broken heart, for example, and
(whatever else is amiss with me) mine is not broken, but healed,
gloriously healed, after its bruises, so thank God for that,
anyway!</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Just had some heavenly sleep and such a sweet dream! I thought
my darling mother came to me. "You're cold, my child," she said,
and then covered me up in the bedclothes. I talked about leaving my
baby, and she said she had had to do the same&mdash;leaving me.
"That's what we mothers come to&mdash;so many of us&mdash;but
heaven is over all," she whispered.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>AUGUST 1. I really cannot understand myself, so it isn't a
matter for much surprise if nobody else understands me. In spite of
what the strange doctor said yesterday I dressed up grandly to-day,
not only in my tea-gown, but some beautiful old white Irish lace
which nurse lent me to wrap about my throat.</p>
<p>I think the effect was rather good, and when I went downstairs
leaning on nurse's shoulder, there was Martin waiting for me, and
though he did not speak (couldn't perhaps), the look that came into
his blue eyes was the same as on that last night at Castle Raa when
he said something about a silvery fir-tree with its dark head
against the sky.</p>
<p>Oh, my own darling, I could wish to live for you, such as I am,
if I could be of any use, if I would not be a hindrance rather than
a help, if our union were right, if, in short, God Himself had not
already answered to all such questionings and beseechings, His
great; unalterable, irrevocable No!</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>AUGUST 2. The Reverend Mother, who arrived in the island last
night, has been with me all day. I think she <i>knows</i>, for she
has said nothing more about the convent&mdash;only (with her eyes
so soft and tender) that she intends to remain with me a little
while, having need of rest herself.</p>
<p>To my surprise and joy, Martin and she have got on famously.
This evening she told me that, in spite of all (I know what she
meant by that), she is willing to believe that he is a true man,
and, notwithstanding his unhappy opinions about the Church, a
Christian gentleman.</p>
<p>Such a touching thing happened to-day. We were all sitting in
the garden, (sun warm, light breeze off the sea, ripe corn
chattering in the field opposite), when I felt a tugging at my
skirts, and who should it be but Isabel, who had been crawling
along the dry grass plucking daisies, and now, dragging herself up
to my side, emptied them into my lap.</p>
<p>No, I will not give way to tears any more as long as I live, yet
it rather "touches me up," as Martin says, to see how one's vainest
dreams seem to come to pass.</p>
<p>I don't know if Martin thought I was going to break down, but he
rattled away about Girlie having two other mothers
now&mdash;Grandma, who would keep her while we were down South, and
the Reverend Mother, who would take her to school when she was old
enough.</p>
<p>So there's nothing more to fear about baby.</p>
<p>But what about Martin himself? Am I dealing fairly in allowing
him to go on with his preparations? isn't it a kind of cruelty not
to tell him the truth?</p>
<p>This problem is preying on my mind. If I could only get some
real sleep perhaps I could solve it.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>AUGUST 3. I am growing weaker every day. No pain; no cough;
nothing but exhaustion. Father Dan told me this morning that I was
growing more than ever like my mother&mdash;that "sweet saint whom
the Lord has made his own." I know what he means&mdash;like her as
she was at the last.</p>
<p>My poor old priest is such a child! A good old man is always a
child&mdash;a woman can see through and through him.</p>
<p>Ah, me! I am cared for now as I never was before, yet I feel
like baby when she is tired after walking round the chairs and
comes to be nursed. What children we all are at the end&mdash;just
children!</p>

<p>AUGUST 4. Father Dan came across, in breathless excitement
to-day. It seems the poor soul has been living in daily dread of
some sort of censure from Rome through his Bishop&mdash;about his
toleration of me, I suppose&mdash;but behold! it's the Bishop
himself who has suffered censure, having been sent into quarantine
at one of the Roman Colleges and forbidden to return to his
diocese.</p>
<p>And now, lo! a large sum of money comes from Rome for the poor
of Ellan, to be distributed by Father Dan!</p>
<p>I think I know whose money it is that has been returned; but the
dear Father suspects nothing, and is full of a great scheme for a
general thanksgiving, with a procession of our village people to
old St. Mary's and then Rosary and Benediction.</p>
<p>It is to come off on the afternoon of the tenth, it seems, my
last day in Ellan, after my marriage, but before my departure.</p>
<p>How God governs everything!</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>AUGUST 6. It is really wrong of me to allow Martin to go on.
This morning he told me he had bought the special license for our
marriage, and this evening he showed me our tickets for
Sydney&mdash;two berths, first cabin, steadiest part of the ship.
Oh, my dear heart, if you only knew that I have had my ticket these
many days, and that it is to take me out first on the Great
Expedition&mdash;to the still bigger Unknown, the Everlasting Sea,
the Immeasurable Eternity!</p>
<p>I must be brave. Although I am a little cowardly sometimes, I
<i>can</i> be brave.</p>
<p>I have definitely decided to-night that I will tell him. But how
can I look into his face and say. . . .</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>AUGUST 7. I have made up my mind to write to Martin. One can say
things so much easier in a letter&mdash;I can, anyway. Even my
voice affects me&mdash;swelling and falling when I am moved, like a
billow on the ocean.</p>
<p>I find my writing cannot any longer be done in a sitting
position in bed, but I can prop my book on my breast and write
lying down.</p>

<h2>MARY O'NEILL'S LETTER TO MARTIN CONRAD</h2>
<p><i>August 9th</i>, 6 A.M.</p>
<p>MY OWN DARLING,&mdash;Strengthen yourself for what I am going to
say. It will be very hard for you&mdash;I know that, dear.</p>
<p>To-morrow we were to have gone to the High Bailiff; this day
week we were to have sailed for Sydney, and two months hence we
were to have reached Winter Quarters.</p>
<p>But I cannot go with you to the High Bailiff's; I cannot go with
you to Sydney; I cannot go with you to Winter Quarters; I cannot go
anywhere from here. It is impossible, quite impossible.</p>
<p>I have loved too much, dear, so the power of life is burnt out
for me. My great love&mdash;love for my mother, for my darling
baby, and above all for you&mdash;has consumed me and I cannot live
much longer.</p>
<p>Forgive me for not telling you this before&mdash;for deceiving
you by saying that I was getting better and growing stronger when I
knew I was not. I used to think it was cowardice which kept me from
telling you the truth, but I see now that it was love, too.</p>
<p>I was so greedy of the happiness I have had since I came to this
house of love that I could not reconcile myself to the loss of it.
You will try to understand that (won't you, dear?), and so forgive
me for keeping you in the dark down to the very last moment.</p>
<p>This will be a great grief to you. I would die with a glad heart
to save you a moment's pain, yet I could not die at ease if I did
not think you would miss me and grieve for me. I like to think that
in the time to come people will say, "Once he loved Mary O'Neill,
and now there is no other woman in the world for him." I should not
be a woman if I did not feel like that&mdash;should I?</p>
<p>But don't grieve too much, dearest. Only think! If I had been
strong and had years and years still to live, what a life would
have been before me&mdash;before both of us.</p>
<p>We couldn't have lived apart, could we? And if we had married I
should never have been able to shake off the thought that the
world, which would always be opening its arms to you, did not want
me. That would be so, wouldn't it&mdash;after all I have gone
through? The world never forgives a woman for the injuries it
inflicts on her itself, and I have had too many wounds, darling, to
stand by your side and be any help to you.</p>
<p>Oh, I know what you would say, dearest. "She gave up everything
for love of me, choosing poverty, obscurity, and pain above wealth
and rank and ease, and therefore I will choose her before
everything else in the world." But I know what would come to us in
the end, dear, and I should always feel that your love for me had
dragged you down, closed many of the doors of life to you. I should
know that you were always hearing behind you the echoing footsteps
of my fate, and that is the only thing I could not bear.</p>
<p>Besides, my darling, there is something else between us in this
world&mdash;the Divine Commandment! Our blessed Lord says we can
never be man and wife, and there is no getting beyond that, is
there?</p>
<p>Oh, don't think I reproach myself with loving you&mdash;that I
think it a sin to do so. I do not now, and never shall. He who made
my heart what it is must know that I am doing no wrong.</p>
<p>And don't think I regret that night at Castle Raa. If I have to
answer to God for that I will do so without fear, because I know He
will know that, when the cruelty and self-seeking of others were
trying to control my most sacred impulses, I was only claiming the
right He gave me to be mistress of myself and sovereign of my
soul.</p>
<p><i>You</i> must not regret it either, dearest, or reproach
yourself in any way, for when we stand together before God's
footstool He will see that from the beginning I was yours and you
were mine, and He will cover us with the wings of His loving
mercy.</p>
<p>Then don't think, dear, that I have ever looked upon what
happened afterwards&mdash;first in Ellan and then in
London&mdash;as, in any sense, a punishment. I have never done that
at any time, and now I believe from the bottom of my heart that, if
I suffered while you were away, it was not for my sin but my
salvation.</p>
<p>Think, dear! If you and I had never met again after my marriage,
and if I had gone on living with the man they had married me to, my
soul would have shrivelled up and died. That is what happens to the
souls of so many poor women who are fettered for life to coarse and
degrading husbands. But my soul has not died, dearest, and it is
not dying, whatever my poor body may do, so I thank my gracious God
for the sweet and pure and noble love that has kept it alive.</p>
<p>All the same, my darling, to marry again is another matter. I
took my vow before the altar, dear, and however ignorantly I took
it, or under whatever persuasion or constraint, it is registered in
heaven.</p>
<p>It cannot be for nothing, dear, that our blessed Lord made that
stern Commandment. The Church may have given a wrong interpretation
to it&mdash;you say it has, and I am too ignorant to answer you,
even if I wished to, which I don't. But I am sure my Lord foresaw
all such mistakes, and all the hardships that would come to many
poor women (perhaps some men, too), as well as the wreck the world
might fall to for want of this unyielding stay, when He issued his
divine and irrevocable law that never under any circumstances
should marriage be broken.</p>
<p>Oh, I am sure of it, dear, quite sure, and before His
unsearchable wisdom I bow my head, although my heart is torn.</p>
<p>Yet think, darling, how light is the burden that is laid upon
us! Marriage vows are for this world only. The marriage law of the
Church which lasts as long as life does not go on one moment
longer. The instant death sets my body free, my soul may fly to
where it belongs. If I were going to live ten, twenty, thirty
years, this might be cold comfort, but I am not.</p>
<p>Then why should we be sorry? You cannot be mine in this life and
I cannot be yours, so Death comes in its mercy and majesty to unite
us! Our love will go far beyond life, and the moment the barrier of
death is passed our union will begin! And once it begins it will
never end! So Death is not really a separator, but a great uniter!
Don't you see that, dearest? One moment of parting&mdash;hardly a
moment, perhaps&mdash;and then we shall be together through all
Eternity! How wonderful! How glorious! How triumphant!</p>
<p>Do you believe in individual immortality, dear? I do. I believe
that in the other life I shall meet and know my dear ones who are
in heaven. More than that, I believe that the instant I pass from
this life I shall live with my dear ones who are still on earth.
That is why I am willing to go&mdash;because I am sure that the
moment I draw my last breath I shall be standing by your side.</p>
<p>So don't let there be any weeping for me, dear. "Nothing is here
for tears; nothing but well and fair." Always remember&mdash;love
is immortal.</p>
<p>I will not say that I could not have wished to live a little
longer&mdash;if things had been otherwise with both of us. I should
like to live to see your book published and your work finished (I
know it will be some day), and baby grow up to be a good girl and a
beautiful one too (for that's something, isn't it?); and I should
like to live a little longer for another reason, a woman's
reason&mdash;simply to be loved, and to be told that I am loved,
for though a woman may know that, she likes to hear it said and is
never tired of hearing it.</p>
<p>But things have gone against us, and it is almost sinfully
ungrateful to regret anything when we have so many reasons for
thankfulness.</p>
<p>And then about Girlie&mdash;I used to think it would be terrible
(for me, I mean) to die before she could be old enough to have any
clear memory of her mother (such as I have of mine) to cherish and
love&mdash;only the cold, blank, unfilled by a face, which must be
all that remains to most of those whose parents passed away while
they were children. But I am not afraid of that now, because I know
that in the future, when our little girl asks about her mother, you
will describe me to her as <i>you</i> saw and remember me&mdash;and
that will be <i>so</i> much sweeter and lovelier than I ever was,
and it will be <i>such</i> a joy to think that my daughter sees me
through her father's eyes.</p>
<p>Besides, dearest, there is something still more
thrilling&mdash;the thought that Girlie may grow to be like me
(like what you <i>think</i> me), and that in the time to come she
may startle you with undescribable resemblances, in her voice or
smile, or laugh, to her mother in heaven, so that some day,
perhaps, years and years hence, when she is quite grown up, she may
touch your arm and you may turn quickly to look at her, and lo! it
will seem to you as if Mary herself (<i>your</i> Mary) were by your
side. Oh Death, where is thy sting? Oh grave, where is thy
victory?</p>
<p>Go on with your great work, dearest. Don't let it flag from any
cold feeling that I am lost to you. Whenever you think of me, say
to yourself, "Mary is here; Love is stronger than death, many
waters cannot quench it."</p>
<p>Did you ever read Browning? I have been doing so during the last
few days, nurse (she is quite a thoughtful woman) having lent me
his last volume. When I read the last lines of what is said to have
been his last poem I thought of you, dear:</p>
<p>"<i>No, at noonday in the bustle of man's work-time<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Greet the unseen with a
cheer!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Bid him forward, breast and back as
either should be,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Strive and thrive!' Cry
'Speed,&mdash;fight on, fare ever</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 3em;">There as
here!'"</span><br /></i></p>
<p>I am going to get up again to-day, dear, having something to do
that is just a little important&mdash;to give you this manuscript
book, in which I have been writing every day (or rather every night
since you found me in London.)</p>
<p>You will see what it is, and why it was written, so I'll say no
more on that subject.</p>
<p>I am afraid you'll find it very egotistical, being mainly about
myself; but I seem to have been looking into my soul all the time,
and when one does that, and gets down to the deep places, one meets
all other souls there, so perhaps I have been writing the lives of
some women as well.</p>
<p>I once thought I could write a real book (you'll see what vain
and foolish things I thought, especially in my darker moments) to
show what a woman's life may be when, from any cause whatsoever,
she is denied the right God gave her of choosing the best for
herself and her children.</p>
<p>There is a dream lying somewhere there, dear, which is stirring
the slumber of mankind, but the awakening will not be in my time
certainly, and perhaps not even in Girlie's.</p>
<p>And yet, why not?</p>
<p>Do you know, dearest, what it was in your wonderful book which
thrilled me most? It was your description of the giant iceberg you
passed in the Antarctic Ocean&mdash;five hundred feet above the
surface of the sea and therefore five hundred below it, going
steadily on and on, against all the force of tempestuous wind and
wave, by power of the current underneath.</p>
<p>Isn't the movement of all great things in life like that,
dearest? So perhaps the world will be a better place for Girlie
than it has been for me. And in any case, I shall always feel that,
after all and in spite of everything, it has been glorious to be a
woman.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>And now, my own darling, though we are only to be separated for
a little while, I want to write what I should like to say when I
part from you to-morrow if I did not know that something in my
throat would choke me.</p>
<p>I want to tell you again that I love you dearly, that I have
never loved anybody but you, and that no marriage vows will keep me
from loving you to the last.</p>
<p>I want to thank you for the great, great love you have given me
in return&mdash;all the way back from the time when I was a child.
Oh, my dearest, may God for ever bless you for the sunshine you
have brought into my life&mdash;every single day of it, joyful days
and sorrowful ones, bright days and dark, but all shining with the
glory of your love.</p>
<p>Never allow yourself to think that my life has not been a happy
one. Looking back on it now I feel as if I have always had
happiness. And when I have not had happiness I have had something
far higher and better&mdash;blessedness.</p>
<p>I have had <i>such</i> joy in my life, dear&mdash;joy in the
beauty of the world, in the sunshine and the moon and the stars and
the flowers and the songs of the birds, and then (apart from the
divine love that is too holy to speak about) in my religion, in my
beloved Church, in the love of my dear mother and my sweet child,
and above all&mdash;above all in <i>you</i>.</p>
<p>I feel a sense of sacred thankfulness to God for giving you to
me, and if it has not been for long in this life, it will be for
ever in the next.</p>
<p>So good-bye, my dearest me&mdash;<i>just for a little
moment</i>! My dearest one, Good-bye!</p>

<h2>MARY O'NEILL'S LAST NOTE<br />
WRITTEN ON THE FLY-LEAVES OF HER MISSAL</h2>
</div>
<p>AUGUST 9-10.</p>
<p>It is all over. I have given him my book. My secret is out. He
knows now. I almost think he has known all along.</p>
<p>I had dressed even more carefully than usual, with nurse's Irish
lace about my neck as a collar, and my black hair brushed smooth in
my mother's manner, and when I went downstairs by help of my usual
kind crutch (it is wonderful how strong I have been to-day)
everybody said how much better I was looking.</p>
<p>Martin was there, and he took me into the garden. It was a
little late in the afternoon, but such a sweet and holy time, with
its clear air and quiet sunshine&mdash;one of those evenings when
Nature is like a nun "breathless with adoration."</p>
<p>Although I had a feeling that it was to be our last time
together we talked on the usual subjects&mdash;the High Bailiff,
the special license, "the boys" of the <i>Scotia</i> who were
coming over for my wedding, and how some of them would have to
start out early in the morning.</p>
<p>But it didn't matter what we talked about. It was only what we
felt, and I felt entirely happy&mdash;sitting there in my cushions,
with my white hand in his brown one, looking into his clear eyes
and ruddy face or up to the broad blue of the sky.</p>
<p>The red sun had begun to sink down behind the dark bar of St.
Mary's Rock, and the daisies in the garden to close their eyes and
drop their heads in sleep, when Martin became afraid of the
dew.</p>
<p>Then we went back to the house&mdash;I walking firmly, by
Martin's side, though I held his arm so close.</p>
<p>The old doctor was in his consulting room, nurse was in my room,
and we could hear Christian Ann upstairs putting baby into her
darling white cot&mdash;she sleeps with grandma now.</p>
<p>The time came for me to go up also, and then I gave him my book,
which I had been carrying under my arm, telling him to read the
last pages first.</p>
<p>Although we had never spoken of my book before he seemed to know
all about it; and it flashed upon me at that moment that, while I
thought I had been playing a game of make-believe with him, he had
been playing a game of make-believe with me, and had known
everything from the first. There was a certain relief in that, yet
there was a certain sting in it, too. What strange creatures we
are, we women!</p>
<p>For some moments we stood together at the bottom of the stairs,
holding each other's hands. I was dreadfully afraid he was going to
break down as he did at Castle Raa, and once again I had that
thrilling, swelling feeling (the most heavenly emotion that comes
into a woman's life, perhaps) that I, the weak one, had to
strengthen the strong.</p>
<p>It was only for a moment, though, and then he put his great
gentle arms about me, and kissed me on the lips, and said,
<i>silently</i> but oh, so eloquently, "Good-bye darling, and God
bless you!"</p>
<p>Then I walked upstairs alone, quite alone, and when I reached
the top he was still at the bottom looking up at me. I smiled down
to him, then walked firmly into my room and up to my bed, and then
. . . down, all my strength gone in a moment.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>I have had such a wonderful experience during the night. It was
like a dream, and yet something more than a dream. I don't want to
make too much of it&mdash;to say that it was a vision or any
supernatural manifestation such as the blessed Margaret Mary speaks
about. Perhaps it was only the result of memory operating on my
past life, my thoughts and desires. But perhaps it was something
higher and more spiritual, and God, for my comforting, has
permitted me to look for one moment behind the veil.</p>
<p>I thought it was to-morrow&mdash;my wedding day, and the day of
Father Dan's thanksgiving celebration&mdash;and I was sitting by my
French window (which was wide open) to look at the procession.</p>
<p>I seemed to see everything&mdash;Father Dan in his surplice, the
fishermen in their clean "ganzies," the village people in their
Sunday clothes, the Rechabites, the Foresters, and the Odd-fellows
with their coloured badges and banners coming round the corner of
the road, and the mothers with babies too young to be left looking
on from the bridge.</p>
<p>I thought the procession passed under my window and went on to
the church, which was soon crowded, leaving numbers of people to
kneel on the path in front, as far down as the crumbling gate piers
which lean towards each other, their foundations having given
way.</p>
<p>Then I thought Benediction began, and when the congregation sang
I sang also. I heard myself singing:</p>
<p>"<i>Mater purissima,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ora pro
nobis."</span><br /></i></p>
<p>Down to this moment I thought I had been alone, but now the
Reverend Mother entered my room, and she joined me. I heard her
deep rich voice under mine:</p>
<p>"<i>Mater castissima<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Ora pro
nobis."</span><br /></i></p>
<p>Then I thought the <i>Ora</i> ended, and in the silence that
followed it I heard Christian Arm talking to baby on the gravel
path below. I had closed my eyes, yet I seemed to see them, for I
felt as if I were under some strange sweet an&aelig;sthetic which
had taken away all pain but not all consciousness.</p>
<p>Then I thought I saw Martin come close under my window and lift
baby up to me, and say something about her.</p>
<p>I tried to answer him and could not, but I smiled, and then
there was darkness, in which I heard voices about me, with somebody
sobbing and Father Dan saying, as he did on the morning my mother
died:</p>
<p>"Don't call her back. She's on her way to God's beautiful
paradise after all her suffering."</p>
<p>After that the darkness became still deeper, and the voices
faded away, and then gradually a great light came, a beautiful,
marvellous, celestial light, such as Martin describes when he
speaks about the aurora, and then . . . I was on a broad white
snowy plateau, and Martin was walking by my side.</p>
<p>How wonderful! How joyful! How eternally glorious!</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>It is 4 A.M. Some of "the boys" will be on their way to my
wedding. Though I have been often ashamed of letting them come I am
glad now for his sake that I didn't try to keep them back. With his
comrades about him he will control himself and be strong.</p>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<p>Such a peaceful morning! There is just light enough to see St.
Mary's Rock. It is like a wavering ghost moving in the vapour on
the face of the deep. I can hear the far-off murmur of the sea. It
is like the humming in a big shell. A bird is singing in the garden
and the swallows are twittering in a nest under the thatch. A mist
is lying over the meadows, and the tree tops seem to be floating
between the earth and the sky.</p>
<p>How beautiful the world is!</p>
<p>Very soon the mist will rise, and the day will break and the sun
will come again and . . . there will be no more night.</p>
<p>[END OF THE NARRATIVE OF MARY O'NEILL]</p>
<p>MEMORANDUM OF MARTIN CONRAD</p>
<p>My darling was right. I had known all along, but I had been
hoping against hope&mdash;that the voyage would set her up, and the
air of the Antarctic cure her.</p>
<p>Then her cheerfulness never failed her, and when she looked at
me with her joyous eyes, and when her soft hand slipped into mine I
forgot all my fears, so the blow fell on me as suddenly as if I had
never expected it.</p>
<p>With a faint pathetic smile she gave me her book and I went back
to my room at the inn and read it. I read all night and far into
the next day&mdash;all her dear story, straight from her heart,
written out in her small delicate, beautiful characters, with
scarcely an erasure.</p>
<p>No use saying what I thought or went through. So many things I
had never known before! Such love as I had never even dreamt of,
and could never repay her for now!</p>
<p>How my whole soul rebelled against the fate that had befallen my
dear one! If I have since come to share, however reluctantly, her
sweet resignation, to bow my head stubbornly where she bowed hers
so meekly (before the Divine Commandment), and to see that
marriage, true marriage, is the rock on which God builds His world,
it was not then that I thought anything about that.</p>
<p>I only thought with bitter hatred of the accursed hypocrisies of
civilised society which, in the names of Law and Religion, had been
crushing the life out of the sweetest and purest woman on earth,
merely because she wished to be "mistress of herself and sovereign
of her soul."</p>
<p>What did I care about the future of the world? Or the movement
of divine truths? Or the new relations of man and woman in the good
time that was to come? Or the tremendous problems of lost and
straying womanhood, or the sufferings of neglected children, or the
tragedies of the whole girlhood of the world? What did I care about
anything but my poor martyred darling? The woman God gave me was
mine and I could not give her up&mdash;not now, after all she had
gone through.</p>
<p>Sometime in the afternoon (heaven knows when) I went back to
Sunny Lodge. The house was very quiet. Baby was babbling on the
hearth-rug. My mother was silent and trying not to let me see her
swollen eyes. My dear one was sleeping, had been sleeping all day
long, the sleep of an angel. Strange and frightening fact, nobody
being able to remember that she had ever been seen to sleep
before!</p>
<p>After a while, sick and cold at heart, I went down to the shore
where we had played as children. The boat we sailed in was moored
on the beach. The tide was far out, making a noise on the teeth of
the Rock, which stood out against the reddening sky, stern, grand,
gloomy.</p>
<p>Old Tommy the Mate came to the door of his cabin. I went into
the quiet smoky place with its earthen floor and sat in a dull
torpor by the hearth, under the sooty "laff" and rafters. The old
man did not say a word to me. He put some turf on the fire and then
sat on a three-legged stool at the other side of the
hearth-place.</p>
<p>Once he got up and gave me a basin of buttermilk, then stirred
the peats and sat down again without speaking. Towards evening,
when the rising sea was growing louder, I got up to go. The old man
followed me to the door, and there, laying his hand on my arm he
said:</p>
<p>"She's been beating to windward all her life, boy. But mind ye
this&mdash;<i>she's fetching the harbour all right at
last</i>."</p>
<p>Going up the road I heard a band of music in the distance, and
saw a procession of people coming down. It was Father Dan's
celebration of thanksgiving to God for what was left of Daniel
O'Neill's ill-gotten wealth sent back from Rome for the poor.</p>
<p>Being in no humour to thank God for anything, I got over a sod
hedge and crossed a field until I came to a back gate to our
garden, near to "William Rufus's" burial place&mdash;stone
overgrown with moss, inscription almost obliterated.</p>
<p>On the path I met my mother, with baby, toddling and tumbling by
her side.</p>
<p>"How is she now?" I asked.</p>
<p>She was awake&mdash;had been awake these two hours, but in a
strange kind of wakefulness, her big angel eyes open and shining
like stars as if smiling at someone whom nobody else could see, and
her lips moving as if speaking some words which nobody else could
hear.</p>
<p>"What art thou saying, <i>boght millish</i>?" my mother had
asked, and after a moment in which she seemed to listen in rapture,
my darling had answered:</p>
<p>"Hush! I am speaking to mamma&mdash;telling her I am leaving
Isabel with Christian Ann. And she is saying she is very glad."</p>
<p>We walked round to the front of the house until we came close
under the window of "Mary O'Neill's little room," which was wide
open.</p>
<p>The evening was so still that we could hear the congregation
singing in the church and on the path in front of it.</p>
<p>Presently somebody began to sing in the room above. It was my
darling&mdash;in her clear sweet silvery voice which I have never
heard the like of in this world and never shall again.</p>
<p>After a moment another voice joined hers&mdash;a deep voice, the
Reverend Mother's.</p>
<p>All else was quiet. Not a sound on earth or in the air. A hush
had fallen on the sea itself, which seemed to be listening for my
precious darling's last breath. The sun was going down, very red in
its setting, and the sky was full of glory.</p>
<p>When the singing came to an end baby was babbling in my mother's
arms&mdash;"Bo-loo-la-la-ma-ma." I took her and held her up to the
open window, crying:</p>
<p>"Look, darling! Here's Girlie!"</p>
<p>There was no answer, but after another moment the Reverend
Mother came to the window. Her pale face was even paler than usual,
and her lips trembled. She did not speak, but she made the sign of
the Cross.</p>
<p>And by that . . . I knew.</p>
<p>"Out of the depths I cry unto thee, O Lord, Lord, hear my
cry."</p>

<h2>THE AUTHOR TO THE READER</h2>
<p>I saw him off at Tilbury when he left England on his last
Expedition. Already he was his own man once more. After the
blinding, stunning effect of the great event there had been a quick
recuperation. His spirit had risen to a wonderful strength and even
a certain cheerfulness.</p>
<p>I did not find it hard to read the secret of this change. It was
not merely that Time, the great assuager, had begun to do its work
with him, but that he had brought himself to accept without qualm
or question Mary O'Neill's beautiful belief (the old, old belief)
in the immortality of personal love, and was firmly convinced that,
freed from the imprisonment of the flesh, she was with him every
day and hour, and that as long as he lived she always would be.</p>
<p>There was nothing vague, nothing fantastic, nothing mawkish,
nothing unmanly about this belief, but only the simple faith of a
steady soul and a perfectly clear brain. It was good to see how it
braced a strong man for life to face Death in that way.</p>
<p>As for his work I found him quite hopeful. His mission apart, I
thought he was looking forward to his third trip to the Antarctic,
in expectation of the silence and solitude of that strengthening
region.</p>
<p>As I watched the big liner that was taking him away disappear
down the Thames I had no more doubt that he would get down to the
South Pole, and finish his task there, than that the sun would rise
the following morning.</p>
<p>Whatever happens this time he will "march breast forward."</p>

<h2>MARTIN CONRAD TO THE AUTHOR</h2>
<p>WIRELESS&mdash;ANTARCTIC CONTINENT (<i>via</i> MACQUARIE ISLAND
AND RADIO HOBART 16).</p>
<p>Arrived safe. All well. Weather excellent. Blue sky. Warm. Not a
breath of wind. Sun never going down. Constellations revolving
without dipping. Feel as if we can see the movement of the world.
Start south to-morrow. Calmer than I have ever been since She was
taken from me. But She was right. She is here. "Love is stronger
than death, many waters cannot quench it."</p>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
